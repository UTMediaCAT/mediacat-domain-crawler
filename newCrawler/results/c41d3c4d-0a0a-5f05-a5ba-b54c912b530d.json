It’s not especially common for losing presidential candidates to hold victory rallies. But this specific post-loss victory rally was particularly awkward given the local political situation. So a bunch of press was there, including Astead Herndon, one of the political reporters at The Times. Three hours before the rally, I found him shaking his head at his iPhone near a bank of blue porta potties. A story he’d just posted was getting blowback.</p></dd><dl><dt>astead herndon</dt><dd><p>The Ossoff people are mad. Because in the story, we call him a former filmmaker. And they say he is a former investigative journalist.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Can you talk a little bit about the four candidates and what they’re like?</p></dd><dt>astead herndon</dt><dd><p>One second.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Sure.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Astead was in Georgia reporting on today’s two Senate runoff elections. Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are challenging Republican candidates Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. And it’s a huge deal. Because if Democrats win these two seats, they’ll gain control of the Senate.</p></dd><dl><dt>astead herndon</dt><dd><p>And if Republicans hold on, that will give them a big check against what Joe Biden is able to do. And this is what this rally is supposed to be about — is about ginning up Republican support for those candidates. But it’s kind of taken a different turn because of how much the president has contested the election.</p></dd></dl><dt>[music - elton john, \"i guess that's why they call it the blues\"]</dt><dd></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Since losing the election on November 3, President Trump had relentlessly attacked the integrity of the election in Georgia. He’d floated conspiracy theories about suitcases stuffed with ballots, claimed repeatedly that voting machines flipped thousands of Trump votes to Biden. And when Republican leaders in Georgia contradicted these claims, or didn’t sing loudly enough in the chorus of stolen election, Trump went after them, too. He’d insulted his former ally, Republican Governor Brian Kemp.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (donald trump)</dt><dd><p>We have a governor, a Republican governor that’s worse than a Democrat. He’s terrible.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>And he so eviscerated the Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger —</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (donald trump)</dt><dd><p>This guy got played like I’ve never seen anybody play.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>— that the Republican Senate candidates, Loeffler and Perdue, called on Raffensperger to resign. Finally, three days before the victory rally, things had really escalated. A couple of Trump surrogates started telling Trump supporters that Perdue and Loeffler weren’t fighting for Trump hard enough.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording</dt><dd><p>If Kelly Loeffler wants your vote, if David Perdue wants your vote, they’ve got to earn it. [CROWD CHEERING]</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Typically in an election like this, you’d have the full strength of the Republican Party marching in perfect lockstep behind the candidates. And the president would stage a rally to get people even more energized. But everything was upside down. Republican allies of the president were actively disparaging Loeffler and Perdue. And Trump was doing little to stop them. In fact, he kind of seemed to enjoy it. Which was an issue because everyone, Democrats and Republicans, agree that this race is going to be really close. It’s the kind of race where even a small dip in turnout could have serious consequences. So calling the G.O.P. candidates and the entire election system into question right before the polls open —</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording</dt><dd><p>Well, we don’t know if it —</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>— was a risk.</p></dd><dt>[music - elton john, \"i guess that's why they call it the blues\"]</dt><dd></dd><dl><dt>astead herndon</dt><dd><p>The fear, particularly of some Republicans in the state, is that the willingness for the kind of Trumpist section to go down the road of conspiracy and misinformation will turn off some voters. Both the ones who say, hey, if the election’s rigged, why should I even support it? And also some of the more moderates who say, why are these Republicans even going down this path? And why can’t they acknowledge the fact that this was a free and fair election? So it just strikes at the unity that Republicans usually have in this state, that has been the reason why they’ve won almost every runoff that’s ever happened here.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Runoff elections are notorious. It’s always a climb to get people to vote when it’s just a local race.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>So do you feel like what he says today will have an impact on the election?</p></dd><dt>astead herndon</dt><dd><p>Yes.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Yes. Like, that was a very certain yes. I wasn’t quite prepared for the level of certainty involved in that yes. So let’s unpack. Why are you so certain?</p></dd><dt>astead herndon</dt><dd><p>The only messenger that matters to a big portion of the Republican base is Donald Trump. And if he says that systems are rigged and maybe they shouldn’t vote, that will be one that folks believe. This is a party that is singularly devoted to one person’s identity and belief. And depending on how he wields that today will 100 percent matter for the runoff.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Hi. Can I talk to you? I’m with The Daily. It’s a podcast. Would that be all right?</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>And it’s true that over the next three hours, as I talk to person after person, it did sound like the voters at the rally had been getting the message the messenger was sending.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>What brought you out here today?</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Uh, the election, it’s not right.</p></dd><dt>speaker 2</dt><dd><p>Tons of fraud and especially, I know, here in Georgia.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Almost every person I spoke to was convinced there had been fraud on a massive scale, and as you can imagine, felt extremely distressed by that idea.</p></dd><dl><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>I mean, they’ve proven it. But you know, they keep playing it down like it’s not that big a deal. It’s a big deal.</p></dd><dt>speaker 2</dt><dd><p>The essence of our republic is pretty much at stake here.</p></dd><dt>speaker 3</dt><dd><p>You know, and if they get away with this, then we’re going to go down the road of Venezuela.</p></dd><dt>archived recording</dt><dd><p>One fraudulent vote is too many, and we’ve got millions of ‘em. Anybody with one eye and half sense knows it’s fraud. It’s fraud. It’s fraud.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>I talked to business owners, lawyers, schoolteachers, farmers, truck drivers. They were all certain. And a good portion were, in fact, directing some of their anger at other Georgia Republicans.</p></dd><dl><dt>lori huff</dt><dd><p>Absolutely. Our Republican leaders have not stood up for us voters. And we are not happy about it. I met Lori Huff, a former prosecutor who now works in real estate law, by a gourmet ice cream truck.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Do you feel like Loeffler and Perdue have?</p></dd><dt>lori huff</dt><dd><p>I haven’t heard them say much at all. I’m very disappointed. Both of them need to stand up.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Does that make you feel like you don’t want to vote for them in January?</p></dd><dt>lori huff</dt><dd><p>It makes me feel like it, yes. I will vote for them, but reluctantly.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Lori told me there were plenty of people in her circle who were bitter about Loeffler and Perdue.</p></dd><dl><dt>lori huff</dt><dd><p>I know a lot of people who are saying they’re not going to vote for them. But when it comes down to it, I don’t think they’re going to sit at home and allow our country to be taken over by the Democrats.</p></dd></dl><dt>[music - backstreet boys, \"i want it that way\"]</dt><dd></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>But they are saying it?</p></dd><dt>lori huff</dt><dd><p>Yes. A lot of people are saying that, absolutely.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Still, at the rally, which granted is a highly motivated, self-selected group, I wasn’t able to find anyone — not a single Republican — ready to sit out the Senate race on January 5. Some knew people threatening not to vote, or knew people who knew people, or were related to people.</p></dd><dl><dt>speaker</dt><dd><p>Some of my relatives say they’re not going to go ahead and vote. They’ve seen video evidence of it getting rigged. And you know, why would they vote in a runoff when they know that’s going to get rigged as well.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>But at least at the rally, the idea was kind of a non-starter, because people were so desperately worried that Democratic control of the Senate, House and the presidency would so fundamentally alter the country that they loved.</p></dd><dl><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>If the Democrats win, then our country is going to be a totally different country. So —</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>When you say that, what do you mean?</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Well, what they’ve been saying. They basically want socialism and communism.</p></dd><dt>speaker 2</dt><dd><p>Marxist and socialist are the other options. So Warnock and Ossoff are full-blown, you know, Marxist.</p></dd><dt>speaker 3</dt><dd><p>We don’t want socialism for sure.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Is that what you’re worried about?</p></dd><dt>speaker 3</dt><dd><p>Oh, hell yes. Absolutely. Oh, my God. I mean, do you? Would you?</p></dd><dt>speaker 4</dt><dd><p>I don’t want to have to stand in line to get a loaf of bread. I don’t want to have to be in a five-mile line to get a few gallons of gas. I don’t want to have to live off of $6 a week. And that’s where we’re headed.</p></dd><dt>speaker 5</dt><dd><p>Bottom line is Republicans aren’t socialists. Democrats are.</p></dd></dl><dt>[music - linkin park, \"in the end\"]</dt><dd></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>As the sky turned dark, more people poured through the police checkpoints. And there was a new energy in the crowd. Finally, a thin point of light appeared in the sky.</p></dd><dl><dt>speaker</dt><dd><p>We believe that’s Trump flying in now. He’s getting ready to land.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>So everybody’s holding up their phones.</p></dd><dt>speaker</dt><dd><p>Everybody’s videoing, taking pictures right now. He’s the man. He is the man.</p></dd><dt>archived recording</dt><dd><p>[CHEERING] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 45th president of the United States of America, President Donald J. Trump. Hello Georgia.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>So what did the 45th president of the United States say?</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (donald trump)</dt><dd><p>You know, we won Georgia, just so you understand.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Much of the speech did veer dangerously in the direction that Republicans feared.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (donald trump)</dt><dd><p>There’s no way this could have happened other than the obvious cheating or a rigged election. There’s no way it could have happened.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Trump said repeatedly that the election had been stolen and that Georgia’s voting system could not be trusted.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (donald trump)</dt><dd><p>People are walking in with suitcases and putting them under a table with a black robe around them.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>But he also did do, for a smaller part of the speech, what local Republican leaders wanted. He reminded everybody to go out and vote.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (donald trump)</dt><dd><p>You must go vote and vote early, starting December 14. You have to do it.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>He said nice things about Perdue and Loeffler.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (donald trump)</dt><dd><p>Because these are two great, great people that I know so well and respected by everybody in Washington and beyond.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>But for me, the most telling part of the night happened when Trump wasn’t even at the mic. He’d passed it briefly to David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. First, Loeffler got up to tell people in the crowd that they really needed to vote.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording</dt><dd><p>(CROWD CHANTING) Stop the steal! Stop the steal!</p></dd><dt>archived recording (kelly loeffler)</dt><dd><p>And so make sure that you vote. We are going to vote!</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>But she was drowned out by a chant of “stop the steal.”</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (kelly loeffler)</dt><dd><p>Because if we don’t vote, we will lose the country. If we vote, we will win!</p></dd><dt>archived recording</dt><dd><p>Stop the steal!</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Then Perdue got up. But, again —</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (david perdue)</dt><dd><p>Hey, guys, I want to take maybe just one second.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>The crowd wouldn’t back off the chant, no matter how much Perdue pleaded.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (david perdue)</dt><dd><p>You guys, I want to say something for President Trump personally. Guys? I want to say something personal for President Trump.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>As Perdue struggled to break through, it felt clear. Though the president wasn’t technically on the ballot, he was still way more important to the voters at this rally than any of the people who were. So Loeffler and Perdue needed to be careful. Neither could afford to contradict Trump, even if his claims made their lives more difficult.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (david perdue)</dt><dd><p>We love you, Mr. President. And we love the first lady. And we’re going to fight and win those two seats and make sure that you get a fair square deal and a Senate majority. God bless you, Mr. President. [CHEERING]</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>In fact, as Perdue walked away, a different chant started taking shape, a chant about exactly what the crowd wanted the Senate candidate leaving the stage to do.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording</dt><dd><p>(CROWD CHANTING) Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump!</p></dd></dl><dt>[music]</dt><dd></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>At the end of the night, if you were a Republican trying to gauge your chance of keeping the Senate, what happened didn’t exactly silence your fear. Republican unity still felt scrambled and the race was really close. But there was still plenty of reason for hope. Historically, Republicans in the state of Georgia have just crushed when it comes to getting out the vote. And the ground game for this runoff was looking even more powerful than usual. So would that tip the balance? Or would Trump’s messiness discourage average Republican voters — the kind of people who don’t feel compelled to show up at Trump rallies — from coming out on January 5?</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Are those your door hangers?</p></dd><dt>canvasser</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Can you show me what they look like?</p></dd><dt>canvasser</dt><dd><p>Sure. There you go. It shows both candidates. And it has some top issues listed underneath their picture. Abortion on demand, of course, Jon Ossoff says yes to that. David Perdue says no.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>One Saturday morning in early December, I met up with a group of political canvassers who’d driven down from North Carolina to help get out the vote. There were 45 people from a church group that were staying at a Country Inn and Suites about an hour north of Atlanta. Their accommodations were being paid for by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a conservative Christian group. And its executive director, Adam Pipkin, agreed to talk to me about their strategy. So after we saw the group off, we climbed into his enormous truck to talk.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Ooh, what are you playing?</p></dd><dt>adam pipkin</dt><dd><p>A little country music.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Let me hear it.</p></dd><dt>archived recording</dt><dd><p>(SINGING) We can’t forget that these are the days.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>These are the days.</p></dd><dt>adam pipkin</dt><dd><p>Yeah. [LAUGHING]</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>So ever since the election, Adam had been working like crazy, 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. most days. He said he had to because his group had expanded so much since the general election. During the election, the Faith and Freedom Coalition had roughly 75 people working in Georgia to get out the vote. But now —</p></dd><dl><dt>adam pipkin</dt><dd><p>Now we have over 900. We’re adding probably 15 to 30 a day. And we have, like, for instance today we’ll probably have 125 folks out knocking doors. Our goal is to average 15,000 doors a day between now and January 5.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>15,000 doors a day — Adam’s canvassers only speak to about 20 percent of the people behind those doors. But still, for Adam, it’s worth the effort. Because door knocking is one of the most effective things you can do to get people to vote.</p></dd><dl><dt>adam pipkin</dt><dd><p>The studies that I have seen, when you’re in a general election or regular election, someone is 15 percent more likely to vote if you go door knocking. They are 70 percent more likely to vote if it is somebody you know from the community that shows up.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Adam had done the math and figured out that his group could hit 500,000 homes by election day. 20 percent of 500,000 is 100,000, which is substantially more than the margin that separated Perdue and Ossoff, for example, on November 3. But here’s the thing. Adam’s group was just one of many independent groups getting out the vote in the state. Then of course, you had the Republican Party itself. Earlier in the week, I’d spoken to the press person for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. And he told me that the N.R.S.C. was hiring 1,000 people to go door-to-door for the runoff. He said their plan was to make sure that every Republican who’d voted in the state of Georgia, including people in hard to reach rural areas, had at least one person knock on their door before January 5.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>I mean, the impression that I get, and you tell me if I’m wrong, but there is an unprecedented machine being marshaled to turn out the vote for this. Is that your impression?</p></dd><dt>adam pipkin</dt><dd><p>Yeah, definitely. And I would think so, right? I mean, I don’t know how you could say otherwise.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>And yet, despite all this, Adam wasn’t 100 percent confident that Republicans would keep the two Senate seats. Again, Republicans have historically won runoff elections. And he thought they still had an edge. But he said the stuff with Trump was making things more complicated.</p></dd><dl><dt>adam pipkin</dt><dd><p>The reality is anyone saying they know how people are going to turn out, because of that, I think it’s a guess. Hopefully, it will not have much effect. But I don’t know the answer to that.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Are you worried?</p></dd><dt>adam pipkin</dt><dd><p>I would say it’s concerning, for sure.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>But it wasn’t just the Trump stuff. There was also the problem of demographics. The population of Georgia is growing by leaps and bounds every year, a boon to the Democrats and, potentially, a threat to Republicans. Adam complains that people come because Georgia’s business-friendly policies have led to an economic boom. But as soon as they get here, they seem to forget the benefits of that conservative approach.</p></dd><dl><dt>adam pipkin</dt><dd><p>They move here and then they still vote the same way from the place that they left, which is, honestly kind of a little annoying.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>He also acknowledges the work that Stacey Abrams has done in registering those new voters in the lead-up to the November election.</p></dd><dl><dt>adam pipkin</dt><dd><p>She has done a great job just getting the Democrats organized. They really weren’t, honestly.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>So do you think that given these demographic changes and Stacey Abrams, do you think it’s possible that the Republicans might be kind of losing their lock on the state?</p></dd><dt>adam pipkin</dt><dd><p>Well, obviously, it’s trending more purple. So I don’t know how it will go. I mean, I think they are in a much better position than they were four years ago, for sure. And I think Republicans just have to work hard and get out the vote.</p></dd><dt>jonathan crooks</dt><dd><p>Did you get the signature? You probably did. And it’s cold. I don’t know about —</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>It’s cold! Is it usually this cold?</p></dd><dt>interposing voices</dt><dd><p>I was feeling so badly. Nope.</p></dd><dt>archived recording</dt><dd><p>Well, you know, we —</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>I wanted to see the ground game in action. So Pipkin hooked me up with one of his full-time canvassers, an older man named Jonathan Crooks.</p></dd><dl><dt>jonathan crooks</dt><dd><p>All right. So now we’re going to go down Magnolia Way.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>We were canvassing in a very upscale neighborhood, huge houses with smooth green lawns. And as we walked, I quizzed Jonathan about the conversations he’d been having with voters.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>How many of the people that you’ve talked to believe that there was fraud in Georgia’s election and that the president won?</p></dd><dt>jonathan crooks</dt><dd><p>There is a great — what I can say with great conviction is that there’s a great concern about it.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Surveys have found that between 70 percent and 80 percent of Republicans don’t believe Biden actually won. And even in early December, 50 percent expected Trump to be inaugurated on January 20. And in the well-to-do suburb north of Atlanta where we were walking, people seemed to feel the same way.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>How do you feel about the last election? Do you think that there was fraud?</p></dd><dt>jonathan crooks</dt><dd><p>Absolutely.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Fraud that changed the outcome?</p></dd><dt>jonathan crooks</dt><dd><p>Yes. Yes. I am very concerned about it.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>It was just like the Trump rally.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Do you feel like there was a lot of fraud in this past election?</p></dd><dt>jonathan crooks</dt><dd><p>Yeah, I do. Actually, I do.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>And are you worried that the fraud changed the result?</p></dd><dt>jonathan crooks</dt><dd><p>I think so. I do believe that.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>But also, just like the Trump rally, literally no one I spoke to said that they would sit out the upcoming election. What was at stake was just too important. And as I walked from door to door, a new thought occurred to me. Whether or not Republicans take these two seats, what’s clear is that over the course of the 2020 election, a profound shift has occurred among Republican voters, and not just the most hardcore of the president’s supporters — a shift that very likely will continue to exist long after January 5 has come and gone.</p></dd><dt>[music]</dt><dd></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>10 years ago, if someone had said to you, look, Democrats have really perpetrated a massive election fraud with ballot stuffing and a whole bunch of things.</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I would have laughed them out of the room!

That’s insane.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Would you really have thought the person was insane?</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Probably.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>I wanted to talk to a Republican in Georgia who represented the 70 percent. Someone who believed the election was stolen and would sit down with me and talk through their thinking. So I was really happy when Aimee Nobile said yes. The day after our first phone conversation, I jumped in my car and drove to her house in the Atlanta suburbs. But when she opened the door, she was dressed as an elf, like, a full elf costume.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Can you just describe each piece?</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>OK.

I don’t have my elf shoes on now, because they’re not conducive for driving.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Aimee had on a green and red Peter Pan dress with small gold bells on the collar. She even had elf ears, though she removed them for the interview. She had just come from her son’s school, where she’d been volunteering all week, going around to classrooms and helping the little kids pick out presents from a catalog for their parents. And it had all been going really well until the principal outed her.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>The principal said on the loudspeaker that there’s an elf running around the school. So now I’ve got a cult following. And if I go past the playground and they’re out on the playground — Elfie! And they come running.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Which was a problem because Covid.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>And they come running. And I can’t hug them, like I knew they were all running at me at one point. So there were, like, 15 kids running at me. And I had to go in the door and slam it. And they’re, like, [LAUGHING] I’m, like I can’t! Help me. Save me from the children. You know, Covid has changed a lot.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>I have to say this is the first time that I’ve ever interviewed an elf.</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>You know, I break a lot of molds.

But she grew up in New York state, the daughter of two public school teachers. And she says their politics were pretty clear.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I asked my dad when I was younger, and what are you? And he said, I’m a Democrat. I said why? Because they’re for the working people. Well, that makes sense. I’ll go with that.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>And that’s where Aimee says she stayed all through her 20s.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>To me, everybody that was a Republican in my 20s was someone that lived in the South, probably banged their Bibles a lot. I didn’t dislike them. I just didn’t understand them. And I thought those poor people need to be enlightened.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>But after a couple of decades in Georgia, surrounded by Republican neighbors and co-workers and friends, her feelings began to migrate. Until eventually, she registered as a Republican. Still, that’s a far cry from believing that Democrats would perpetrate a massive national fraud.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>You know how there are some people who are naturally more suspicious? And then there are some people who are naturally not as suspicious? Which one are you?</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>So on a personal note, I tend to trust individuals. Am I distrusting of the government? No. But I’m more skeptical. I’m a New Yorker by birth. If someone says, this is going to cure this, or this is going to do — I’m, like yeah, sure. But I would not call myself on any way a conspiracy theorist. I don’t like conspiracy theories. I’ve had crazy friends throughout the years who have had all kinds of conspiracy — I’m, like, OK. Have a nice day. I don’t argue with them. I just keep going. That’s why at this moment in time, I’m in a conflict within myself. Because it feels strange to me to say that there’s been massive fraud in this country. And where it goes? How far does it go? How crazy do you go? But —</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>But, like so many others in her party, that is what she now believes. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly how she ended up here. It’s been a slow process. But certainly one important milestone came after Trump declared his run for presidency in 2015. As a New Yorker, Aimee was intrigued. But she still liked other conservative candidates. And then Trump came to Georgia to talk.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>And I wanted to hear for myself what he had to say. So I went and he said, I think NATO’s obsolete. And I said, where the heck’s he going with this, NATO’s obsolete? He says, well, they don’t address terrorism. And I went what? He said listen, it’s not addressed. And he said, here’s what the press is going to say on Monday. And I listened. And he said, they’re going to say, “Trump Against NATO.” Did I just say that to you? He said, I told you they’re not addressing terrorism, therefore they are obsolete. They are going to report that I said Trump is against NATO. I’m not against NATO. I think it’s great. But it needs to be brought to this century. People need to pay their fair share. And they need to address terrorism. And I thought, God, I agree with him. And sure enough, Monday morning: “Trump Against NATO.” I was, like, well, he said that’s exactly how that would go. So that began my distrust in the media and Trump’s relationship right there. Because I said, they’re not reporting what he said. He was very clear. He spelled it out, what he meant. And he said this is how they’re going to report it. I said, my ears don’t lie to me. I heard it. And I was fascinated.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>I went back and reviewed the speech. And it went a little differently than that. It was that night, at the speech, that the president said he’d been misinterpreted by the media in the past for his comments on NATO. But the point is, Aimee says by then she’d already started to consume more right-leaning media, like Fox News. But was constantly flipping channels from Fox to CNN and back. And says that she began to feel like traditionally mainstream outlets, like The New York Times, or CNN, or The Washington Post were only telling part of the story, like they left out anything good.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>He donates his entire salary to charity. And I have said that to people and still had them go, that’s not true. Or they go what? They don’t even know it.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>She had a bunch of examples.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Like, for instance, there’s very little talk recently, and I know that my friends on the left know nothing about the fact that Trump just had three major peace treaties in the Middle East. That’s a big deal.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>To her, it just seemed obvious that most mainstream media outlets were not interested in any narrative about Trump that could be construed as positive. It made her feel manipulated.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Let’s not look over there. Come on. Come on. No, we’re focusing over here. No, no, no, no, no. There’s nothing to see over there. Come back. Come back. And that bothers me, because knowledge is power. And information should be out there.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Despite being a Republican, she says for a long time she’d been dismissive of people on the right who complained about bias in the media.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I’m, like, wah, wah, wah. Quit your crying. You know? Like, I’m a Republican. But quit whining. Who cares? And the more I started listening, I’m like, yeah, that’s not being reported correctly. And I don’t know the day it started. I don’t know the moment. But it slowly went from wah, wah, wah to yeah, it’s a little bad to — it’s kind of pretty bad to — well, this is terrible.</p><p>It’s all about orange man bad. That’s our joke on the right. And I’m sure I found myself craving the information that made more sense to me.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>To Aimee, it felt like for the whole of Trump’s presidency the mainstream media was looking for ways to delegitimize his win.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Let’s see. First it was he lost the popular vote. He’s not a legitimate president. Then it was Russia. [DOG BARKING] He’s not a legitimate president. And he colluded. And then three years, I watched all this insanity. And I thought, oh, my God. The man is never going to be a legitimate president, no matter what he does.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>As the 2020 election approached, Aimee says she was a little concerned about the possibility of something going funny with the mail-in ballots. But she felt good about her own state.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Definitely felt better. I thought, OK, we’re safe here in Georgia. And I thought strongly Georgia would go red, as it usually does.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>On Election Day, she volunteered as a poll watcher. She says less out of concern and more just to be a good citizen. And she says she felt really positive about how things went.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I had my little slice of information. And I went home on Election Day and watched all the results. And around 11 o’clock at night, things were looking good. And then everything stopped.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Everything stopped, you mean they stopped counting?</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Stopped counting, yeah. Everything stopped.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Aimee says by the next morning it felt like she was living in a different world.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Put yourself in our shoes for a moment. We woke up the next day. We thought we were winning. We slowly saw everything go crazy. Nobody knew who won. We’d had a fear of ballots being mailed in for a long time, and being told this will be a hot mess, and we’re not going to know who won for weeks. And sure enough, tick, tick, check, check, all those things are happening. Oh, we don’t know who won.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>So Aimee volunteered for one of those voter fraud hotlines. She says all day long she fielded calls from voters.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>People were just beside themselves upset. This has been stolen. How could we let this happen? What are the Republicans doing? We are furious. We need to act. We need to get moving.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>And in between those emotionally wrenching calls, she said she did talk to a couple of people who were reporting things that to her ear sounded suspicious, like a male poll worker from a county in a different part of the state.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>They stuck them on a chair outside the room and said, watch from here. And he’s, like, I can’t. I mean, I’m not even in the room.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>And suddenly, the situation flipped.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I’m seeing everything that was said to me four years ago that I didn’t like. It’s not fair. It’s, you know, it’s not a legitimate election.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>It was so confusing to Aimee.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Are we drinking the Russian Kool-Aid like they did, you know? Like, is this, OK, Russia, Russia, Russia, fraud, fraud, fraud. You know? And I say this to myself every day. This is what people on the left were going through the day after Trump won.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>For days, every time she turned on her television or picked up her phone, she saw some new report that enraged her. She listened to hearings where lawyers got up and made what sounded to her like very credible and specific accusations.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>66,000 underage people voted. Over 10,000 dead people voted. 2,600 felons voted.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>But she told me the thing that finally sealed the deal for her was that press conference that Rudy Giuliani had where he brought out a huge stack of signed affidavits from Trump supporters alleging that they’d seen fraud.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>The affidavits that he wouldn’t show? Those ones?</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I see what you’re saying. But yes, he would not show them. However, to me, I wouldn’t show them,= either.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Aimee thinks it can be dangerous to be a Trump supporter. People have been doxxed. People have been harassed. People have been hurt. In fact, earlier, she’d asked me not to use her husband’s name. He’s a data guru who works in tech.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I’d like to keep him out of it. There’s a big fear on our side that we could lose our jobs for being — you know? Especially certain companies — he used to work for a company out of Silicon Valley. And he was terrified if I was active, he would lose his job.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>That fear was understandable to me. But it was also true that whenever I presented information that contradicted her own narrative, Aimee would explain it away.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>So what do you think about the fact that pretty much all of the courts have looked at the evidence and have dismissed the cases?</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>It doesn’t necessarily deter me. Does it feel great? Does it feel like we’re scoring wins? Absolutely not.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>She had a rationale for the rejected court cases all over the country.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Nobody wants to touch it. Nobody wants to be the person to rule on it. They want to push it down — up the chain, and let it go to the Supreme Court.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>And also an explanation as to why Georgia’s top three Republicans had announced there had not been substantial fraud.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Does it ever make you feel like, look, these are Republicans. They have the same goals that I have. They are looking at the evidence, but they are not —</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>No! No. There’s corrupt Republicans.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Aimee had voted for Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia. And until this election, had really liked him.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>How do you make sense of that?</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I don’t. Except now — and this is the next conspiracy that’s being said, and, again, I don’t know if I believe this yet — but if it were true, it would explain a lot. Kemp and Duncan supposedly have been paid, either by China or Dominion or both.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>After all, she pointed out, just the week before, 17 states had joined a Texas lawsuit filed to the Supreme Court. Their claim was that there had been so many problems with election procedures in the four swing states, their electoral votes should be disqualified. And for Aimee, it seemed obvious that state officials would not join a lawsuit like that if there were no actual grounds.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Those are governments. These are educated people that have thought about it.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>This was a few days before the Supreme Court rejected the case. So neither of us knew how it was going to turn out.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>If it goes to the Supreme Court and they say no, there is not enough evidence of fraud here, will you believe it then?</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I don’t know if I’ll believe it. But I’ll accept it, for sure. Believe it?</p><p>Oh, that’s a tough one. Not — you know, it’s a good question. I probably should.</p><p>I don’t know if I’ve fought so hard, have so many other patriots saying, hey, no, no, no, no. There’s fraud. I know I would accept it. I think I would probably always have a doubt in the back of my mind. And there’s a part of me that would be just fine saying Biden is an illegitimate president for four years if he makes it four years. Because not to be vengeful, because I’m not that person, but it just would feel good to be able to say it for four years and see how that feels. It’s been done to Trump. And it makes me so frustrated. And it’s frustrated us for three years, four years. And that’s sad to me, that I’m petty that way. Because it is petty. But people have just been hateful.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>From Aimee’s perspective, for four years, the way the press and many of her Democratic friends talked about the person she voted for and believed in, it had been incredibly challenging.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I have people that I know, I love and I trust. And I know they’re smart. And I know they’re special. And I know that they are no less intelligent than I am. But they believe that what I’m thinking is just bat poop crazy. And I’m looking at them going, what you believe is bat poop crazy. And I don’t believe we’re both crazy. I don’t think either of us is crazy. But every day, they’re going to turn on a channel that’s going to tell them I’m crazy and Trump is horrible. And every day, I’m going to turn on the channel that says Trump is the greatest thing since sliced bread and they’re nuts and they’re lying. And where does that leave everybody? Angry! Divided.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Aimee says she feels her heart beginning to harden.</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I’m starting to get angry at the people on the left instead of curious. Like, it’s going from, “I want to know what makes you tick” to, “Oh, you just wear me out. You know, there’s nothing to talk to you about anymore. You’re just — you’re one of them.” And I want to keep walking. And I have to fight with my own self to go, no. They’re just a person like you. And they’ve just been told what they believe. But every day, it’s harder to respect that you can believe that. I fight with myself every day. Because if we don’t listen to other people, how will this ever stop?</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Do you think that you and the Republicans you know are more likely to believe in things that before you would have dismissed as conspiracies? Because I’m trying to figure out, is it, like, has conspiratorial kind of thinking grown over the last four years?</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Yeah. And that’s because of two things, in my opinion. Number one, the media, as I’ve harped on. And number two, the fact that so many of these conspiracies have come out over the years, it’s almost impossible not to believe them. It gets almost easier every time.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>As for Georgia’s runoff elections on January 5 —</p></dd><dl><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>I have zero confidence in my vote counting on January 5. Zero confidence.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Do you think that you’ll ever have faith when you walk into a voting booth again?</p></dd><dt>aimee nobile</dt><dd><p>Not if Donald Trump doesn’t win. And I don’t mean that because I feel like if he doesn’t win, everything is unfair. I mean that because if somehow Democrats have found a way to cheat, why would they stop?</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Hello, there. Hi. Thank you so much for meeting with me. I really, really appreciate it.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>When I went to visit Gabe Sterling, it had been about a week since he’d been at the center of the news cycle in Georgia. Gabe has a very unglamorous title: Voting System Implementation Manager. But a small press conference he’d held had gone viral after he’d made a very emotional plea for Trump and other Republican officials to stop peddling disinformation. So when I met up with him, he was still dealing with the fallout from all of that. As I placed my equipment on the table, he was reading off his iPhone.</p></dd><dl><dt>gabe sterling</dt><dd><p>You can see my fresh death threats.</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Oh, you’re going into your fresh death threats.</p></dd><dt>gabe sterling</dt><dd><p>Yeah. That always gets your —</p></dd><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Do you want to read some for me?</p></dd><dt>gabe sterling</dt><dd><p>I can show you some.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>He showed me this website that apparently had been put up earlier in the day.</p></dd><dl><dt>gabe sterling</dt><dd><p>Basically, it has a picture of me with a sniper target on my face with my home address, with a picture of my house. And it also has the governor and Secretary of State.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>For weeks, Gabriel’s office had been consumed with providing definitive proof that the election in Georgia had been legit. They debunked claim after claim, did a full paper recount, and had publicly reported all of their findings so that voters could have faith that their vote would be counted on January 5. But he knew it wasn’t convincing people.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (gabe sterling)</dt><dd><p>You keep on basically screaming at the ocean, I guess, to a degree.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Which in my mind, raised this question.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>If Republican voters in the state of Georgia, where the entire process was run essentially by Republicans, won’t believe their own Republican leaders, what that suggests is in any other state, there’s not going to be a way to convince people. Do you think there will be a way to convince people?</p></dd><dt>archived recording (gabe sterling)</dt><dd><p>It will take a huge unmasking of the president for him to — he will never — I’ll put money on that — he will never admit that this wasn’t stolen from him and that he just lost the race. As long as that’s the case, there are going to be millions of Americans who are going to feel in their heart and their gut and go to their graves knowing this election was stolen from them. And there’s no piece of evidence, there’s no, like, silver bullet. There’s nothing that’s going to change their minds.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>In fact, like Aimee, Gabriel thinks the public’s willingness to believe conspiracy theories is only growing.</p></dd><dl><dt>archived recording (gabe sterling)</dt><dd><p>Yeah, I mean, I’ve heard of highly educated people, you know, lawyers, doctors, teachers who believe in their heart of hearts that this thing was stolen. And I think the conspiratorial stuff fits, because why would they lie about it?</p><p>The president and the congressman and all the other people who are spreading some of this stuff, these are people of respect. I mean, why would they lie? It doesn’t make any sense.</p></dd></dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>In the weeks since I first talked to Gabriel, the president and his supporters have continued to tell voters that the election was stolen from them. And then, of course, came Saturday afternoon. In an hour-long phone call to Secretary Raffensperger, the president didn’t just ask Georgia’s secretary of state to find 11,000 votes. He spoke at length of the massive fraud he believed had been perpetrated. If you listen to the whole thing, he himself sounds so convinced, far from a man who would back off the claim that the presidency had unjustly been taken from him. And so, as Gabe said, voters will probably believe that, too, regardless of what happens today.</p></dd><dl><dt>alix spiegel</dt><dd><p>Do you think that if Republicans win both seats in the Senate that that will help convince people that there wasn’t massive fraud on November 3?</p></dd><dt>archived recording (gabe sterling)</dt><dd><p>Likely. There’s still going to be — people who are the hardcore Trump supporters will still believe it. Now will it go from 7 to 10 down to 6 to 10? I don’t know. Does it go to 5 to 10? I mean, any percentage that high is unhealthy. So yes, I’m sure that it will help. But it’ll help on the margins.</p></dd></dl><dt>michael barbaro</dt><dd><p>On Monday night, Senator Kelly Loeffler announced plans to vote against the certification of Joe Biden’s victory when Congress convenes on Wednesday. In doing so, she will endorse President Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud.

Hat, scarf, hoodies!speaker 2I got $20.speaker 1OK. $10 is your change.alix spiegelOne month ago, before President Trump’s leaked attempt to pressure Georgia’s election officials became national news, he headlined an event billed as a victory rally in Valdosta, Georgia. It’s not especially common for losing presidential candidates to hold victory rallies. But this specific post-loss victory rally was particularly awkward given the local political situation. So a bunch of press was there, including Astead Herndon, one of the political reporters at The Times. Three hours before the rally, I found him shaking his head at his iPhone near a bank of blue porta potties. A story he’d just posted was getting blowback.astead herndonThe Ossoff people are mad. Because in the story, we call him a former filmmaker. And they say he is a former investigative journalist.alix spiegelCan you talk a little bit about the four candidates and what they’re like?astead herndonOne second.alix spiegelSure.alix spiegelAstead was in Georgia reporting on today’s two Senate runoff elections. Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are challenging Republican candidates Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. And it’s a huge deal. Because if Democrats win these two seats, they’ll gain control of the Senate.astead herndonAnd if Republicans hold on, that will give them a big check against what Joe Biden is able to do. And this is what this rally is supposed to be about — is about ginning up Republican support for those candidates. But it’s kind of taken a different turn because of how much the president has contested the election.[music - elton john, \"i guess that's why they call it the blues\"]alix spiegelSince losing the election on November 3, President Trump had relentlessly attacked the integrity of the election in Georgia. He’d floated conspiracy theories about suitcases stuffed with ballots, claimed repeatedly that voting machines flipped thousands of Trump votes to Biden. And when Republican leaders in Georgia contradicted these claims, or didn’t sing loudly enough in the chorus of stolen election, Trump went after them, too. He’d insulted his former ally, Republican Governor Brian Kemp.archived recording (donald trump)We have a governor, a Republican governor that’s worse than a Democrat. He’s terrible.alix spiegelAnd he so eviscerated the Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger —archived recording (donald trump)This guy got played like I’ve never seen anybody play.alix spiegel— that the Republican Senate candidates, Loeffler and Perdue, called on Raffensperger to resign. Finally, three days before the victory rally, things had really escalated. A couple of Trump surrogates started telling Trump supporters that Perdue and Loeffler weren’t fighting for Trump hard enough.archived recordingIf Kelly Loeffler wants your vote, if David Perdue wants your vote, they’ve got to earn it. [CROWD CHEERING]alix spiegelTypically in an election like this, you’d have the full strength of the Republican Party marching in perfect lockstep behind the candidates. And the president would stage a rally to get people even more energized. But everything was upside down. Republican allies of the president were actively disparaging Loeffler and Perdue. And Trump was doing little to stop them. In fact, he kind of seemed to enjoy it. Which was an issue because everyone, Democrats and Republicans, agree that this race is going to be really close. It’s the kind of race where even a small dip in turnout could have serious consequences. So calling the G.O.P. candidates and the entire election system into question right before the polls open —archived recordingWell, we don’t know if it —alix spiegel— was a risk.[music - elton john, \"i guess that's why they call it the blues\"]astead herndonThe fear, particularly of some Republicans in the state, is that the willingness for the kind of Trumpist section to go down the road of conspiracy and misinformation will turn off some voters. Both the ones who say, hey, if the election’s rigged, why should I even support it? And also some of the more moderates who say, why are these Republicans even going down this path? And why can’t they acknowledge the fact that this was a free and fair election? So it just strikes at the unity that Republicans usually have in this state, that has been the reason why they’ve won almost every runoff that’s ever happened here.alix spiegelRunoff elections are notorious. It’s always a climb to get people to vote when it’s just a local race.alix spiegelSo do you feel like what he says today will have an impact on the election?astead herndonYes.alix spiegelYes. Like, that was a very certain yes. I wasn’t quite prepared for the level of certainty involved in that yes. So let’s unpack. Why are you so certain?astead herndonThe only messenger that matters to a big portion of the Republican base is Donald Trump. And if he says that systems are rigged and maybe they shouldn’t vote, that will be one that folks believe. This is a party that is singularly devoted to one person’s identity and belief. And depending on how he wields that today will 100 percent matter for the runoff.alix spiegelHi. Can I talk to you? I’m with The Daily. It’s a podcast. Would that be all right?alix spiegelAnd it’s true that over the next three hours, as I talk to person after person, it did sound like the voters at the rally had been getting the message the messenger was sending.alix spiegelWhat brought you out here today?speaker 1Uh, the election, it’s not right.speaker 2Tons of fraud and especially, I know, here in Georgia.alix spiegelAlmost every person I spoke to was convinced there had been fraud on a massive scale, and as you can imagine, felt extremely distressed by that idea.speaker 1I mean, they’ve proven it. But you know, they keep playing it down like it’s not that big a deal. It’s a big deal.speaker 2The essence of our republic is pretty much at stake here.speaker 3You know, and if they get away with this, then we’re going to go down the road of Venezuela.archived recordingOne fraudulent vote is too many, and we’ve got millions of ‘em. Anybody with one eye and half sense knows it’s fraud. It’s fraud. It’s fraud.alix spiegelI talked to business owners, lawyers, schoolteachers, farmers, truck drivers. They were all certain. And a good portion were, in fact, directing some of their anger at other Georgia Republicans.lori huffAbsolutely. Our Republican leaders have not stood up for us voters. And we are not happy about it. I met Lori Huff, a former prosecutor who now works in real estate law, by a gourmet ice cream truck.alix spiegelDo you feel like Loeffler and Perdue have?lori huffI haven’t heard them say much at all. I’m very disappointed. Both of them need to stand up.alix spiegelDoes that make you feel like you don’t want to vote for them in January?lori huffIt makes me feel like it, yes. I will vote for them, but reluctantly.alix spiegelLori told me there were plenty of people in her circle who were bitter about Loeffler and Perdue.lori huffI know a lot of people who are saying they’re not going to vote for them. But when it comes down to it, I don’t think they’re going to sit at home and allow our country to be taken over by the Democrats.[music - backstreet boys, \"i want it that way\"]alix spiegelBut they are saying it?lori huffYes. A lot of people are saying that, absolutely.alix spiegelStill, at the rally, which granted is a highly motivated, self-selected group, I wasn’t able to find anyone — not a single Republican — ready to sit out the Senate race on January 5. Some knew people threatening not to vote, or knew people who knew people, or were related to people.speakerSome of my relatives say they’re not going to go ahead and vote. They’ve seen video evidence of it getting rigged. And you know, why would they vote in a runoff when they know that’s going to get rigged as well.alix spiegelBut at least at the rally, the idea was kind of a non-starter, because people were so desperately worried that Democratic control of the Senate, House and the presidency would so fundamentally alter the country that they loved.speaker 1If the Democrats win, then our country is going to be a totally different country. So —alix spiegelWhen you say that, what do you mean?speaker 1Well, what they’ve been saying. They basically want socialism and communism.speaker 2Marxist and socialist are the other options. So Warnock and Ossoff are full-blown, you know, Marxist.speaker 3We don’t want socialism for sure.alix spiegelIs that what you’re worried about?speaker 3Oh, hell yes. Absolutely. Oh, my God. I mean, do you? Would you?speaker 4I don’t want to have to stand in line to get a loaf of bread. I don’t want to have to be in a five-mile line to get a few gallons of gas. I don’t want to have to live off of $6 a week. And that’s where we’re headed.speaker 5Bottom line is Republicans aren’t socialists. Democrats are.[music - linkin park, \"in the end\"]alix spiegelAs the sky turned dark, more people poured through the police checkpoints. And there was a new energy in the crowd. Finally, a thin point of light appeared in the sky.speakerWe believe that’s Trump flying in now. He’s getting ready to land.alix spiegelSo everybody’s holding up their phones.speakerEverybody’s videoing, taking pictures right now. He’s the man. He is the man.archived recording[CHEERING] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 45th president of the United States of America, President Donald J. Trump. Hello Georgia.alix spiegelSo what did the 45th president of the United States say?archived recording (donald trump)You know, we won Georgia, just so you understand.alix spiegelMuch of the speech did veer dangerously in the direction that Republicans feared.archived recording (donald trump)There’s no way this could have happened other than the obvious cheating or a rigged election. There’s no way it could have happened.alix spiegelTrump said repeatedly that the election had been stolen and that Georgia’s voting system could not be trusted.archived recording (donald trump)People are walking in with suitcases and putting them under a table with a black robe around them.alix spiegelBut he also did do, for a smaller part of the speech, what local Republican leaders wanted. He reminded everybody to go out and vote.archived recording (donald trump)You must go vote and vote early, starting December 14. You have to do it.alix spiegelHe said nice things about Perdue and Loeffler.archived recording (donald trump)Because these are two great, great people that I know so well and respected by everybody in Washington and beyond.alix spiegelBut for me, the most telling part of the night happened when Trump wasn’t even at the mic. He’d passed it briefly to David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. First, Loeffler got up to tell people in the crowd that they really needed to vote.archived recording(CROWD CHANTING) Stop the steal! Stop the steal!archived recording (kelly loeffler)And so make sure that you vote. We are going to vote!alix spiegelBut she was drowned out by a chant of “stop the steal.”archived recording (kelly loeffler)Because if we don’t vote, we will lose the country. If we vote, we will win!archived recordingStop the steal!alix spiegelThen Perdue got up. But, again —archived recording (david perdue)Hey, guys, I want to take maybe just one second.alix spiegelThe crowd wouldn’t back off the chant, no matter how much Perdue pleaded.archived recording (david perdue)You guys, I want to say something for President Trump personally. Guys? I want to say something personal for President Trump.alix spiegelAs Perdue struggled to break through, it felt clear. Though the president wasn’t technically on the ballot, he was still way more important to the voters at this rally than any of the people who were. So Loeffler and Perdue needed to be careful. Neither could afford to contradict Trump, even if his claims made their lives more difficult.archived recording (david perdue)We love you, Mr. President. And we love the first lady. And we’re going to fight and win those two seats and make sure that you get a fair square deal and a Senate majority. God bless you, Mr. President. [CHEERING]alix spiegelIn fact, as Perdue walked away, a different chant started taking shape, a chant about exactly what the crowd wanted the Senate candidate leaving the stage to do.archived recording(CROWD CHANTING) Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump![music]alix spiegelAt the end of the night, if you were a Republican trying to gauge your chance of keeping the Senate, what happened didn’t exactly silence your fear. Republican unity still felt scrambled and the race was really close. But there was still plenty of reason for hope. Historically, Republicans in the state of Georgia have just crushed when it comes to getting out the vote. And the ground game for this runoff was looking even more powerful than usual. So would that tip the balance? Or would Trump’s messiness discourage average Republican voters — the kind of people who don’t feel compelled to show up at Trump rallies — from coming out on January 5?alix spiegelAre those your door hangers?canvasserYeah.alix spiegelCan you show me what they look like?canvasserSure. There you go. It shows both candidates. And it has some top issues listed underneath their picture. Abortion on demand, of course, Jon Ossoff says yes to that. David Perdue says no.alix spiegelOne Saturday morning in early December, I met up with a group of political canvassers who’d driven down from North Carolina to help get out the vote. There were 45 people from a church group that were staying at a Country Inn and Suites about an hour north of Atlanta. Their accommodations were being paid for by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a conservative Christian group. And its executive director, Adam Pipkin, agreed to talk to me about their strategy. So after we saw the group off, we climbed into his enormous truck to talk.alix spiegelOoh, what are you playing?adam pipkinA little country music.alix spiegelLet me hear it.archived recording(SINGING) We can’t forget that these are the days.alix spiegelThese are the days.adam pipkinYeah. [LAUGHING]alix spiegelSo ever since the election, Adam had been working like crazy, 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. most days. He said he had to because his group had expanded so much since the general election. During the election, the Faith and Freedom Coalition had roughly 75 people working in Georgia to get out the vote. But now —adam pipkinNow we have over 900. We’re adding probably 15 to 30 a day. And we have, like, for instance today we’ll probably have 125 folks out knocking doors. Our goal is to average 15,000 doors a day between now and January 5.alix spiegel15,000 doors a day — Adam’s canvassers only speak to about 20 percent of the people behind those doors. But still, for Adam, it’s worth the effort. Because door knocking is one of the most effective things you can do to get people to vote.adam pipkinThe studies that I have seen, when you’re in a general election or regular election, someone is 15 percent more likely to vote if you go door knocking. They are 70 percent more likely to vote if it is somebody you know from the community that shows up.alix spiegelAdam had done the math and figured out that his group could hit 500,000 homes by election day. 20 percent of 500,000 is 100,000, which is substantially more than the margin that separated Perdue and Ossoff, for example, on November 3. But here’s the thing. Adam’s group was just one of many independent groups getting out the vote in the state. Then of course, you had the Republican Party itself. Earlier in the week, I’d spoken to the press person for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. And he told me that the N.R.S.C. was hiring 1,000 people to go door-to-door for the runoff. He said their plan was to make sure that every Republican who’d voted in the state of Georgia, including people in hard to reach rural areas, had at least one person knock on their door before January 5.alix spiegelI mean, the impression that I get, and you tell me if I’m wrong, but there is an unprecedented machine being marshaled to turn out the vote for this. Is that your impression?adam pipkinYeah, definitely. And I would think so, right? I mean, I don’t know how you could say otherwise.alix spiegelAnd yet, despite all this, Adam wasn’t 100 percent confident that Republicans would keep the two Senate seats. Again, Republicans have historically won runoff elections. And he thought they still had an edge. But he said the stuff with Trump was making things more complicated.adam pipkinThe reality is anyone saying they know how people are going to turn out, because of that, I think it’s a guess. Hopefully, it will not have much effect. But I don’t know the answer to that.alix spiegelAre you worried?adam pipkinI would say it’s concerning, for sure.alix spiegelBut it wasn’t just the Trump stuff. There was also the problem of demographics. The population of Georgia is growing by leaps and bounds every year, a boon to the Democrats and, potentially, a threat to Republicans. Adam complains that people come because Georgia’s business-friendly policies have led to an economic boom. But as soon as they get here, they seem to forget the benefits of that conservative approach.adam pipkinThey move here and then they still vote the same way from the place that they left, which is, honestly kind of a little annoying.alix spiegelHe also acknowledges the work that Stacey Abrams has done in registering those new voters in the lead-up to the November election.adam pipkinShe has done a great job just getting the Democrats organized. They really weren’t, honestly.alix spiegelSo do you think that given these demographic changes and Stacey Abrams, do you think it’s possible that the Republicans might be kind of losing their lock on the state?adam pipkinWell, obviously, it’s trending more purple. So I don’t know how it will go. I mean, I think they are in a much better position than they were four years ago, for sure. And I think Republicans just have to work hard and get out the vote.jonathan crooksDid you get the signature? You probably did. And it’s cold. I don’t know about —alix spiegelIt’s cold! Is it usually this cold?interposing voicesI was feeling so badly. Nope.archived recordingWell, you know, we —alix spiegelI wanted to see the ground game in action. So Pipkin hooked me up with one of his full-time canvassers, an older man named Jonathan Crooks.jonathan crooksAll right. So now we’re going to go down Magnolia Way.alix spiegelWe were canvassing in a very upscale neighborhood, huge houses with smooth green lawns. And as we walked, I quizzed Jonathan about the conversations he’d been having with voters.alix spiegelHow many of the people that you’ve talked to believe that there was fraud in Georgia’s election and that the president won?jonathan crooksThere is a great — what I can say with great conviction is that there’s a great concern about it.alix spiegelSurveys have found that between 70 percent and 80 percent of Republicans don’t believe Biden actually won. And even in early December, 50 percent expected Trump to be inaugurated on January 20. And in the well-to-do suburb north of Atlanta where we were walking, people seemed to feel the same way.alix spiegelHow do you feel about the last election? Do you think that there was fraud?jonathan crooksAbsolutely.alix spiegelFraud that changed the outcome?jonathan crooksYes. Yes. I am very concerned about it.alix spiegelIt was just like the Trump rally.alix spiegelDo you feel like there was a lot of fraud in this past election?jonathan crooksYeah, I do. Actually, I do.alix spiegelAnd are you worried that the fraud changed the result?jonathan crooksI think so. I do believe that.alix spiegelBut also, just like the Trump rally, literally no one I spoke to said that they would sit out the upcoming election. What was at stake was just too important. And as I walked from door to door, a new thought occurred to me. Whether or not Republicans take these two seats, what’s clear is that over the course of the 2020 election, a profound shift has occurred among Republican voters, and not just the most hardcore of the president’s supporters — a shift that very likely will continue to exist long after January 5 has come and gone.[music]alix spiegel10 years ago, if someone had said to you, look, Democrats have really perpetrated a massive election fraud with ballot stuffing and a whole bunch of things.aimee nobileI would have laughed them out of the room! [LAUGHING] I would have said, you’re crazy. How could they even do that? That’s insane.alix spiegelWould you really have thought the person was insane?aimee nobileProbably.alix spiegelI wanted to talk to a Republican in Georgia who represented the 70 percent. Someone who believed the election was stolen and would sit down with me and talk through their thinking. So I was really happy when Aimee Nobile said yes. The day after our first phone conversation, I jumped in my car and drove to her house in the Atlanta suburbs. But when she opened the door, she was dressed as an elf, like, a full elf costume.alix spiegelCan you just describe each piece?aimee nobileOK. Let’s see. I have striped tights. I don’t have my elf shoes on now, because they’re not conducive for driving.alix spiegelAimee had on a green and red Peter Pan dress with small gold bells on the collar. She even had elf ears, though she removed them for the interview. She had just come from her son’s school, where she’d been volunteering all week, going around to classrooms and helping the little kids pick out presents from a catalog for their parents. And it had all been going really well until the principal outed her.aimee nobileThe principal said on the loudspeaker that there’s an elf running around the school. So now I’ve got a cult following. And if I go past the playground and they’re out on the playground — Elfie! And they come running.alix spiegelWhich was a problem because Covid.aimee nobileAnd they come running. And I can’t hug them, like I knew they were all running at me at one point. So there were, like, 15 kids running at me. And I had to go in the door and slam it. And they’re, like, [LAUGHING] I’m, like I can’t! Help me. Save me from the children. You know, Covid has changed a lot.alix spiegelI have to say this is the first time that I’ve ever interviewed an elf.aimee nobileYou know, I break a lot of molds. I’m that girl.alix spiegelAimee had been in Georgia for more than 20 years. She works as an independent sales rep. But she grew up in New York state, the daughter of two public school teachers. And she says their politics were pretty clear.aimee nobileI asked my dad when I was younger, and what are you? And he said, I’m a Democrat. I said why? Because they’re for the working people. Well, that makes sense. I’ll go with that.alix spiegelAnd that’s where Aimee says she stayed all through her 20s.aimee nobileTo me, everybody that was a Republican in my 20s was someone that lived in the South, probably banged their Bibles a lot. I didn’t dislike them. I just didn’t understand them. And I thought those poor people need to be enlightened.alix spiegelBut after a couple of decades in Georgia, surrounded by Republican neighbors and co-workers and friends, her feelings began to migrate. Until eventually, she registered as a Republican. Still, that’s a far cry from believing that Democrats would perpetrate a massive national fraud.alix spiegelYou know how there are some people who are naturally more suspicious? And then there are some people who are naturally not as suspicious? Which one are you?aimee nobileSo on a personal note, I tend to trust individuals. Am I distrusting of the government? No. But I’m more skeptical. I’m a New Yorker by birth. If someone says, this is going to cure this, or this is going to do — I’m, like yeah, sure. But I would not call myself on any way a conspiracy theorist. I don’t like conspiracy theories. I’ve had crazy friends throughout the years who have had all kinds of conspiracy — I’m, like, OK. Have a nice day. I don’t argue with them. I just keep going. That’s why at this moment in time, I’m in a conflict within myself. Because it feels strange to me to say that there’s been massive fraud in this country. And where it goes? How far does it go? How crazy do you go? But —alix spiegelBut, like so many others in her party, that is what she now believes. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly how she ended up here. It’s been a slow process. But certainly one important milestone came after Trump declared his run for presidency in 2015. As a New Yorker, Aimee was intrigued. But she still liked other conservative candidates. And then Trump came to Georgia to talk.aimee nobileAnd I wanted to hear for myself what he had to say. So I went and he said, I think NATO’s obsolete. And I said, where the heck’s he going with this, NATO’s obsolete? He says, well, they don’t address terrorism. And I went what? He said listen, it’s not addressed. And he said, here’s what the press is going to say on Monday. And I listened. And he said, they’re going to say, “Trump Against NATO.” Did I just say that to you? He said, I told you they’re not addressing terrorism, therefore they are obsolete. They are going to report that I said Trump is against NATO. I’m not against NATO. I think it’s great. But it needs to be brought to this century. People need to pay their fair share. And they need to address terrorism. And I thought, God, I agree with him. And sure enough, Monday morning: “Trump Against NATO.” I was, like, well, he said that’s exactly how that would go. So that began my distrust in the media and Trump’s relationship right there. Because I said, they’re not reporting what he said. He was very clear. He spelled it out, what he meant. And he said this is how they’re going to report it. I said, my ears don’t lie to me. I heard it. And I was fascinated.alix spiegelI went back and reviewed the speech. And it went a little differently than that. It was that night, at the speech, that the president said he’d been misinterpreted by the media in the past for his comments on NATO. But the point is, Aimee says by then she’d already started to consume more right-leaning media, like Fox News. But was constantly flipping channels from Fox to CNN and back. And says that she began to feel like traditionally mainstream outlets, like The New York Times, or CNN, or The Washington Post were only telling part of the story, like they left out anything good.aimee nobileHe donates his entire salary to charity. And I have said that to people and still had them go, that’s not true. Or they go what? They don’t even know it.alix spiegelShe had a bunch of examples.aimee nobileLike, for instance, there’s very little talk recently, and I know that my friends on the left know nothing about the fact that Trump just had three major peace treaties in the Middle East. That’s a big deal.alix spiegelTo her, it just seemed obvious that most mainstream media outlets were not interested in any narrative about Trump that could be construed as positive. It made her feel manipulated.aimee nobileLet’s not look over there. Come on. Come on. No, we’re focusing over here. No, no, no, no, no. There’s nothing to see over there. Come back. Come back. And that bothers me, because knowledge is power. And information should be out there.alix spiegelDespite being a Republican, she says for a long time she’d been dismissive of people on the right who complained about bias in the media.aimee nobileI’m, like, wah, wah, wah. Quit your crying. You know? Like, I’m a Republican. But quit whining. Who cares? And the more I started listening, I’m like, yeah, that’s not being reported correctly. And I don’t know the day it started. I don’t know the moment. But it slowly went from wah, wah, wah to yeah, it’s a little bad to — it’s kind of pretty bad to — well, this is terrible.It’s all about orange man bad. That’s our joke on the right. And I’m sure I found myself craving the information that made more sense to me.alix spiegelTo Aimee, it felt like for the whole of Trump’s presidency the mainstream media was looking for ways to delegitimize his win.aimee nobileLet’s see. First it was he lost the popular vote. He’s not a legitimate president. Then it was Russia. [DOG BARKING] He’s not a legitimate president. And he colluded. And then three years, I watched all this insanity. And I thought, oh, my God. The man is never going to be a legitimate president, no matter what he does.alix spiegelAs the 2020 election approached, Aimee says she was a little concerned about the possibility of something going funny with the mail-in ballots. But she felt good about her own state.aimee nobileDefinitely felt better. I thought, OK, we’re safe here in Georgia. And I thought strongly Georgia would go red, as it usually does.alix spiegelOn Election Day, she volunteered as a poll watcher. She says less out of concern and more just to be a good citizen. And she says she felt really positive about how things went.aimee nobileI had my little slice of information. And I went home on Election Day and watched all the results. And around 11 o’clock at night, things were looking good. And then everything stopped.alix spiegelEverything stopped, you mean they stopped counting?aimee nobileStopped counting, yeah. Everything stopped.alix spiegelAimee says by the next morning it felt like she was living in a different world.aimee nobilePut yourself in our shoes for a moment. We woke up the next day. We thought we were winning. We slowly saw everything go crazy. Nobody knew who won. We’d had a fear of ballots being mailed in for a long time, and being told this will be a hot mess, and we’re not going to know who won for weeks. And sure enough, tick, tick, check, check, all those things are happening. Oh, we don’t know who won.alix spiegelSo Aimee volunteered for one of those voter fraud hotlines. She says all day long she fielded calls from voters.aimee nobilePeople were just beside themselves upset. This has been stolen. How could we let this happen? What are the Republicans doing? We are furious. We need to act. We need to get moving.alix spiegelAnd in between those emotionally wrenching calls, she said she did talk to a couple of people who were reporting things that to her ear sounded suspicious, like a male poll worker from a county in a different part of the state.aimee nobileThey stuck them on a chair outside the room and said, watch from here. And he’s, like, I can’t. I mean, I’m not even in the room.alix spiegelAnd suddenly, the situation flipped.aimee nobileI’m seeing everything that was said to me four years ago that I didn’t like. It’s not fair. It’s, you know, it’s not a legitimate election.alix spiegelIt was so confusing to Aimee.aimee nobileAre we drinking the Russian Kool-Aid like they did, you know? Like, is this, OK, Russia, Russia, Russia, fraud, fraud, fraud. You know? And I say this to myself every day. This is what people on the left were going through the day after Trump won.alix spiegelFor days, every time she turned on her television or picked up her phone, she saw some new report that enraged her. She listened to hearings where lawyers got up and made what sounded to her like very credible and specific accusations.aimee nobile66,000 underage people voted. Over 10,000 dead people voted. 2,600 felons voted.alix spiegelBut she told me the thing that finally sealed the deal for her was that press conference that Rudy Giuliani had where he brought out a huge stack of signed affidavits from Trump supporters alleging that they’d seen fraud.alix spiegelThe affidavits that he wouldn’t show? Those ones?aimee nobileI see what you’re saying. But yes, he would not show them. However, to me, I wouldn’t show them,= either.alix spiegelAimee thinks it can be dangerous to be a Trump supporter. People have been doxxed. People have been harassed. People have been hurt. In fact, earlier, she’d asked me not to use her husband’s name. He’s a data guru who works in tech.aimee nobileI’d like to keep him out of it. There’s a big fear on our side that we could lose our jobs for being — you know? Especially certain companies — he used to work for a company out of Silicon Valley. And he was terrified if I was active, he would lose his job.alix spiegelThat fear was understandable to me. But it was also true that whenever I presented information that contradicted her own narrative, Aimee would explain it away.alix spiegelSo what do you think about the fact that pretty much all of the courts have looked at the evidence and have dismissed the cases?aimee nobileIt doesn’t necessarily deter me. Does it feel great? Does it feel like we’re scoring wins? Absolutely not.alix spiegelShe had a rationale for the rejected court cases all over the country.aimee nobileNobody wants to touch it. Nobody wants to be the person to rule on it. They want to push it down — up the chain, and let it go to the Supreme Court.alix spiegelAnd also an explanation as to why Georgia’s top three Republicans had announced there had not been substantial fraud.alix spiegelDoes it ever make you feel like, look, these are Republicans. They have the same goals that I have. They are looking at the evidence, but they are not —aimee nobileNo! No. There’s corrupt Republicans.alix spiegelAimee had voted for Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia. And until this election, had really liked him.alix spiegelHow do you make sense of that?aimee nobileI don’t. Except now — and this is the next conspiracy that’s being said, and, again, I don’t know if I believe this yet — but if it were true, it would explain a lot. Kemp and Duncan supposedly have been paid, either by China or Dominion or both.alix spiegelAfter all, she pointed out, just the week before, 17 states had joined a Texas lawsuit filed to the Supreme Court. Their claim was that there had been so many problems with election procedures in the four swing states, their electoral votes should be disqualified. And for Aimee, it seemed obvious that state officials would not join a lawsuit like that if there were no actual grounds.aimee nobileThose are governments. These are educated people that have thought about it.alix spiegelThis was a few days before the Supreme Court rejected the case. So neither of us knew how it was going to turn out.alix spiegelIf it goes to the Supreme Court and they say no, there is not enough evidence of fraud here, will you believe it then?aimee nobileI don’t know if I’ll believe it. But I’ll accept it, for sure. Believe it?Oh, that’s a tough one. Not — you know, it’s a good question. I probably should.I don’t know if I’ve fought so hard, have so many other patriots saying, hey, no, no, no, no. There’s fraud. I know I would accept it. I think I would probably always have a doubt in the back of my mind. And there’s a part of me that would be just fine saying Biden is an illegitimate president for four years if he makes it four years. Because not to be vengeful, because I’m not that person, but it just would feel good to be able to say it for four years and see how that feels. It’s been done to Trump. And it makes me so frustrated. And it’s frustrated us for three years, four years. And that’s sad to me, that I’m petty that way. Because it is petty. But people have just been hateful.alix spiegelFrom Aimee’s perspective, for four years, the way the press and many of her Democratic friends talked about the person she voted for and believed in, it had been incredibly challenging.aimee nobileI have people that I know, I love and I trust. And I know they’re smart. And I know they’re special. And I know that they are no less intelligent than I am. But they believe that what I’m thinking is just bat poop crazy. And I’m looking at them going, what you believe is bat poop crazy. And I don’t believe we’re both crazy. I don’t think either of us is crazy. But every day, they’re going to turn on a channel that’s going to tell them I’m crazy and Trump is horrible. And every day, I’m going to turn on the channel that says Trump is the greatest thing since sliced bread and they’re nuts and they’re lying. And where does that leave everybody? Angry! Divided.alix spiegelAimee says she feels her heart beginning to harden.aimee nobileI’m starting to get angry at the people on the left instead of curious. Like, it’s going from, “I want to know what makes you tick” to, “Oh, you just wear me out. You know, there’s nothing to talk to you about anymore. You’re just — you’re one of them.” And I want to keep walking. And I have to fight with my own self to go, no. They’re just a person like you. And they’ve just been told what they believe. But every day, it’s harder to respect that you can believe that. I fight with myself every day. Because if we don’t listen to other people, how will this ever stop?alix spiegelDo you think that you and the Republicans you know are more likely to believe in things that before you would have dismissed as conspiracies? Because I’m trying to figure out, is it, like, has conspiratorial kind of thinking grown over the last four years?aimee nobileYeah. And that’s because of two things, in my opinion. Number one, the media, as I’ve harped on. And number two, the fact that so many of these conspiracies have come out over the years, it’s almost impossible not to believe them. It gets almost easier every time.alix spiegelAs for Georgia’s runoff elections on January 5 —aimee nobileI have zero confidence in my vote counting on January 5. Zero confidence.alix spiegelDo you think that you’ll ever have faith when you walk into a voting booth again?aimee nobileNot if Donald Trump doesn’t win. And I don’t mean that because I feel like if he doesn’t win, everything is unfair. I mean that because if somehow Democrats have found a way to cheat, why would they stop?alix spiegelHello, there. Hi. Thank you so much for meeting with me. I really, really appreciate it.alix spiegelWhen I went to visit Gabe Sterling, it had been about a week since he’d been at the center of the news cycle in Georgia. Gabe has a very unglamorous title: Voting System Implementation Manager. But a small press conference he’d held had gone viral after he’d made a very emotional plea for Trump and other Republican officials to stop peddling disinformation. So when I met up with him, he was still dealing with the fallout from all of that. As I placed my equipment on the table, he was reading off his iPhone.gabe sterlingYou can see my fresh death threats.alix spiegelOh, you’re going into your fresh death threats.gabe sterlingYeah. That always gets your —alix spiegelDo you want to read some for me?gabe sterlingI can show you some.alix spiegelHe showed me this website that apparently had been put up earlier in the day.gabe sterlingBasically, it has a picture of me with a sniper target on my face with my home address, with a picture of my house. And it also has the governor and Secretary of State.alix spiegelFor weeks, Gabriel’s office had been consumed with providing definitive proof that the election in Georgia had been legit. They debunked claim after claim, did a full paper recount, and had publicly reported all of their findings so that voters could have faith that their vote would be counted on January 5. But he knew it wasn’t convincing people.archived recording (gabe sterling)You keep on basically screaming at the ocean, I guess, to a degree.alix spiegelWhich in my mind, raised this question.alix spiegelIf Republican voters in the state of Georgia, where the entire process was run essentially by Republicans, won’t believe their own Republican leaders, what that suggests is in any other state, there’s not going to be a way to convince people. Do you think there will be a way to convince people?archived recording (gabe sterling)It will take a huge unmasking of the president for him to — he will never — I’ll put money on that — he will never admit that this wasn’t stolen from him and that he just lost the race. As long as that’s the case, there are going to be millions of Americans who are going to feel in their heart and their gut and go to their graves knowing this election was stolen from them. And there’s no piece of evidence, there’s no, like, silver bullet. There’s nothing that’s going to change their minds.alix spiegelIn fact, like Aimee, Gabriel thinks the public’s willingness to believe conspiracy theories is only growing.archived recording (gabe sterling)Yeah, I mean, I’ve heard of highly educated people, you know, lawyers, doctors, teachers who believe in their heart of hearts that this thing was stolen. And I think the conspiratorial stuff fits, because why would they lie about it?The president and the congressman and all the other people who are spreading some of this stuff, these are people of respect. I mean, why would they lie? It doesn’t make any sense.alix spiegelIn the weeks since I first talked to Gabriel, the president and his supporters have continued to tell voters that the election was stolen from them. And then, of course, came Saturday afternoon. In an hour-long phone call to Secretary Raffensperger, the president didn’t just ask Georgia’s secretary of state to find 11,000 votes. He spoke at length of the massive fraud he believed had been perpetrated. If you listen to the whole thing, he himself sounds so convinced, far from a man who would back off the claim that the presidency had unjustly been taken from him. And so, as Gabe said, voters will probably believe that, too, regardless of what happens today.alix spiegelDo you think that if Republicans win both seats in the Senate that that will help convince people that there wasn’t massive fraud on November 3?archived recording (gabe sterling)Likely. There’s still going to be — people who are the hardcore Trump supporters will still believe it. Now will it go from 7 to 10 down to 6 to 10? I don’t know. Does it go to 5 to 10? I mean, any percentage that high is unhealthy. So yes, I’m sure that it will help. But it’ll help on the margins.michael barbaroOn Monday night, Senator Kelly Loeffler announced plans to vote against the certification of Joe Biden’s victory when Congress convenes on Wednesday. In doing so, she will endorse President Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud. Polls in Georgia will close tonight at 7 p.m. But because of the large volume of mail in ballots, the results of the runoffs may not be known for several days.We’ll be right back.Here’s what else you need to know today.archived recording (boris johnson)With most of the country already under extreme measures, it’s clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out.michael barbaroBritain, which has already shut down non-essential businesses, widened its lockdown on Monday, ordering that schools and colleges be closed, and asking residents to remain home for all but essential travel.archived recording (boris johnson)In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown, which is tough enough to contain this variant.michael barbaroThe stricter lockdown is intended to reduce transmission of the new coronavirus variant that has swept the United Kingdom over the past few weeks and begun to overwhelm its hospitals. The new version of the virus is now spreading across the world and the United States. On Monday, New York became the fourth American state to detect the variant. Today’s episode was produced by Alix Spiegel with help from Robert Jimison, Austin Mitchell and Neena Pathak. It was edited by Lisa Tobin and engineered by Chris Wood.That’s it for The Daily. I’m Michael Barbaro.
