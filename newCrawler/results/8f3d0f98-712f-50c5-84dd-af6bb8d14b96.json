By investigating a different type of asteroid (type C) from the Itokawa asteroid (type S) that was the target of Hayabusa, Hayabusa 2 will explore not only the origins of the planets but also the origin of the water of Earth&amp;#39;s oceans and the source of life.\nHayabusa 2 will more or less follow the sample return method carried out by the first Hayabusa. However, many improvements have been made to increase reliability so that missions can be completed with greater accuracy. On the other hand, the probe will be put towards new missions using new technology such as technology for creating artificial craters on the surface of the asteroid and carrying back samples of the underground soil. Improving probe technology for astronomical objects in the solar system is an important goal of Hayabusa 2.\nHayabusa 2 aims to examine the Ryugu asteroid (162173). Ryugu is a type C asteroid, but it is believed that there were organic matter and water on the asteroid when the solar system was created (roughly 4.6 billion years ago) and that these still exist. The second goal of Hayabusa 2 is to solve questions such as where the Earth&amp;#39;s water came from and where the organic matter which makes up life was created. Still another goal of Hayabusa 2 is to examine how the planets were created through the collision, destruction, and combination of the planetesimals which are thought to have been created first. In short, Hayabusa 2 is a mission designed to elucidate the secrets of the creation of life and the birth of the solar system.\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180627093531-02-hayabusa-2-large-169.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/05/world/hayabusa2-asteroid-sample-earth-return-scn-trnd/index.html"},{"title":"<img alt=\"\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/201101073141-07-stunning-micro-houses-large-169.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/stunning-micro-houses/index.html"},{"title":"'It looks like a virus': Australia's new trade logo proves controversial","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/australia-logo-design/index.html"},{"title":"World's tallest hybrid timber tower to be built in Sydney","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/videos/architecture/2020/06/25/sydney-hybrid-timber-tower-lon-orig-tp.cnn"},{"title":"<img alt=\"\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/201230060926-01-australia-sea-rescue-large-169.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/australia-sea-rescue-intl-scli/index.html"},{"title":"The 11 days of drama at sea that changed cruising forever","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/11-days-cruising-changed-forever/index.html"},{"title":"Aerial videos show bushfire burn through world's largest sand island (December 2020)","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/videos/travel/2020/12/01/fraser-island-bushfire-travel-lon-orig-na.cnn"},{"title":"<img alt=\"\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/201216101701-table-tennis-stock-large-169.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/16/sport/table-tennis-australia-match-fixing-corruption-spt-intl/index.html"},{"title":"Argentina rugby captain Pablo Matera, two other players suspended for 'discriminatory and xenophobic' social media posts","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/01/football/argentina-rugby-pablo-matera-guido-petti-santiago-socino-spt-intl/index.html"},{"title":"'My own death felt preferable to anybody discovering I was gay,' says former rugby player Dan Palmer","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/30/sport/dan-palmer-wallabies-rugby-spt-intl/index.html"},{"title":"<img alt=\"A photo taken by an ICU nurse of David Johnson for his family after doctors told the family Johnson&amp;#39;s chance of surviving were approaching &amp;quot;statistically zero.&amp;quot; \" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/201120150441-03-david-johnson-cbs-reporter-covid-19-mississippi-large-169.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/20/health/david-johnson-cbs-sports-covid-19-mississippi/index.html"},{"title":"After record low flu season in Australia, US hopes for the same","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/07/health/covid-flu-season-fall/index.html"},{"title":"See how layered masks affect spread of Covid-19","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/videos/app-health-section/2020/07/23/mask-test-study-wellness.cnn"},{"title":"<img alt=\"WUHAN, CHINA - JANUARY 1: (CHIHA OUT) People release balloons into the air to celebrate the new year on January 1st, 2021 in Wuhan, Hubei Province,China.Wuhan With no recorded cases of community transmissions since May 2020, life for residents is gradually returning to normal.(Photo by Getty Images)\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210101094631-wuhan-new-year-2021-large-169.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/31/asia/crowds-wuhan-new-year-intl-hnk-scli/index.html"},{"title":"China approves Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine, promises free shots for all citizens","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/30/asia/china-sinopharm-vaccine-efficacy-intl-hnk/index.html"},{"title":"Neither human rights concerns nor US disapproval could stop the EU-China investment agreement","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/31/asia/eu-china-trade-deal-human-rights-us-intl-hnk/index.html"},{"title":"<img alt=\" President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House August 10, 2020 in Washington, DC.
