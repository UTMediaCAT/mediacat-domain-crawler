The Benelux countries joined the Treaty and in April 1949 expanded further to include North America and Canada followed by Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. This new military alliance became the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). The organisation grew with Greece and Turkey becoming members and a re-armed West Germany was permitted in 1955. This encouraged the creation of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact delineating the two sides of the Cold War. This year marks the 70th anniversary of NATO.

The center of the scene (lat -8, long 78) shows the entire Valles Marineris canyon system, over 2000 kilometers long and up to 8 kilometers deep, extending form Noctis Labyrinthus, the arcuate system of graben to the west, to the chaotic terrain to the east. Many huge ancient river channels begin from the chaotic terrain from north-central canyons and run north. The three Tharsis volcanoes (dark red spots), each about 25 kilometers high, are visible to the west. South of Valles Marineris is very ancient terrain covered by many impact craters. \" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150928112839-mars-file-large-tease.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/15/opinions/green-ethics-of-mars-settlement/index.html"},{"title":"<img alt=\"\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019182552-back-to-the-future-day-3-large-tease.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/20/opinions/wheeler-back-to-the-future-day/index.html"},{"title":"<img alt=\"\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151003125448-13-yr-old-cupp-large-tease.jpeg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/05/opinions/cupp-being-13-bullying/index.html"},{"title":"<img alt=\"late show stephen colbert intv vice president joe biden orig pkg_00011223.jpg\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150911013342-late-show-stephen-colbert-intv-vice-president-joe-biden-orig-pkg-00011223-large-tease.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/11/opinions/parini-biden-colbert/index.html"},{"title":"<img alt=\"\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150723155234-cnnmoneyrichcouples-large-tease.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/05/opinions/abbott-declercq-pregnancy-loss/index.html"},{"title":"<img alt=\"Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina speaks at TechCrunch&amp;#39;s Disrupt conference on May 5, 2015 in New York City. \" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150507114614-carly-fiorina-techcrunch-may-5-2015-large-169.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/21/opinions/zelizer-why-run-for-president/index.html"},{"title":"<img alt=\"\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150402172613-top-opeds-so-far-large-169.jpg\">","date":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/02/opinions/top-cnn-opeds-april-2015/index.html"},{"title":"<img alt=\"A member of the Syrian Red Crescent inspect rubble searching for victims in the rebel-held area of Douma, east of the capital Damascus, following shelling and air raids by Syrian government forces on August 22, 2015.
