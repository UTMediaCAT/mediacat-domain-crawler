the U.S. Senate. The two Republican candidates hold small leads in the vote count, and still have a chance to hold onto those advantages, but most of the remaining vote is in Democratic-leaning areas.</p><p>The largest block of remaining ballots is the in-person vote in DeKalb County, a heavily Democratic area that includes part of Atlanta. Over all, the two Democratic candidates are favored to win the remaining vote by around nine percentage points, according to Upshot estimates.</p><p>Democrats benefited from strong turnout among Black voters, who are on track to represent a much larger share of the electorate than they did in the general election, based on the turnout by precinct and early voting data.</p><p>With 5 percent of the vote left to count, the Rev. Raphael Warnock’s projected lead over Senator Kelly Loeffler is larger than Jon Ossoff’s projected lead over David Perdue. It’s hard to say when either race will be called. The Ossoff-Perdue call might have to wait until late absentee and provisional ballots are counted.</p></div><div data-test-id=\"live-blog-post\" data-source-id=\"100000007535674\"><div><div><p><span><img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png\"></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime=\"2021-01-06T03:35:29.585Z\"><p><span>Jan. 5, 2021, 10:35 p.m. ET</span><span>1 hour ago</span></p></time><span aria-live=\"polite\">1 hour ago</span></span></p><p><span>By </span><span>The New York Times</span></p></div></div></div><section id=\"05blog-ga-afterdark\" data-id=\"100000007535654\"><div data-sourceid=\"100000007535654\">\n      \n    <section aria-label=\"Gallery\" data-id=\"722408994276006\" data-on-slide=\"0\" initialized=\"true\"><div><ol><li data-slide=\"0\" data-typename=\"Image\" data-source-id=\"100000007535621\" data-sources=\"\" data-duration=\"\"><figure><img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/05/us/politics/05blog-ga-afterdark-1/05blog-ga-afterdark-1-square640.jpg\" load=\"\" draggable=\"false\" onerror=\"this.style.opacity=0\"><figcaption>Atlanta</figcaption></figure><span>Lynsey Weatherspoon for The New York Times</span></li><li data-slide=\"1\" data-typename=\"Image\" data-source-id=\"100000007535618\" data-sources=\"\" data-duration=\"\"><figure><img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/05/us/politics/05blog-ga-afterdark-2/05blog-ga-afterdark-2-square640.jpg\" load=\"lazy\" draggable=\"false\" onerror=\"this.style.opacity=0\"><figcaption>Atlanta</figcaption></figure><span>Ben Gray/Associated Press</span></li><li data-slide=\"2\" data-typename=\"Image\" data-source-id=\"100000007535620\" data-sources=\"\" data-duration=\"\"><figure><img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/05/us/politics/05blog-ga-afterdark-3/05blog-ga-afterdark-3-square640.jpg\" load=\"lazy\" draggable=\"false\" onerror=\"this.style.opacity=0\"><figcaption>Atlanta</figcaption></figure><span>Alex Wong/Getty Images</span></li><li data-slide=\"3\" data-typename=\"Image\" data-source-id=\"100000007535656\" data-sources=\"\" data-duration=\"\"><figure><img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/05/us/politics/05blog-ga-afterdark-4/05blog-ga-afterdark-4-square640.jpg\" load=\"lazy\" draggable=\"false\" onerror=\"this.style.opacity=0\"><figcaption>Marietta</figcaption></figure><span>Nicole Craine for The New York Times</span></li><li data-slide=\"4\" data-typename=\"Image\" data-source-id=\"100000007535619\" data-sources=\"\" data-duration=\"\"><figure><img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/05/us/politics/05blog-ga-afterdark-5/05blog-ga-afterdark-5-square640.jpg\" load=\"lazy\" draggable=\"false\" onerror=\"this.style.opacity=0\"><figcaption>Atlanta</figcaption></figure><span>Erik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></li></ol></div><nav><span></span><ol><li data-active=\"true\">slide 1</li><li data-active=\"false\">slide 2</li><li data-active=\"false\">slide 3</li><li data-active=\"false\">slide 4</li><li data-active=\"false\">slide 5</li></ol></nav></section></div></section><p>After a relatively smooth day at the polls, Georgia began the long process of counting votes and awaiting results.</p></div><section id=\"reporter_update-e8780145-a0d1-4ef7-999b-2a8c512dff5a\" data-id=\"\"><div data-sourceid=\"\">\n      \n    <div id=\"68\"><div><p><img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/17/reader-center/author-shaila-dewan2/63655eaa83174300944ab422db1e33c2-thumbLarge.png\" alt=\"Shaila Dewan headshot\"></p></div><p>If the Dems exceed Biden’s margins in blue counties, that seems to support Stacey Abrams’s argument that the key is not persuading swing voters, it’s getting left-leaning voters to the polls.  </p></div></div></section><section id=\"reporter_update-2beb5b66-78ed-44dd-878f-c33a5b64e66c\" data-id=\"\"><div data-sourceid=\"\">\n      \n    <div id=\"66\"><div><p><img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/multimedia/author-jeremy-w-peters/author-jeremy-w-peters-thumbLarge.png\" alt=\"Jeremy Peters headshot\"></p></div><p>Republicans pleaded with Trump to care about this race.

Raphael Warnock, who appeared to be performing slightly more strongly than Jon Ossoff, the party’s other contender.</p><p>If Mr. Warnock were to succeed, it would be a fitting culmination to an election cycle in which, hours after Joseph R. Biden Jr. was declared the president-elect, he told Black voters in his victory speech, “You’ve always had my back, and I’ll have yours.”</p><div><p>It would also be a generational breakthrough for Southern Black Democrats.</p><p>Mr. Warnock, 51, the pastor who took the pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, has spoken on the campaign trail about his life experiences as a Black man born and raised in the South. He is running for office in a state where people in predominantly Black neighborhoods waited in disproportionately long lines to vote last year, and where one study found that more than 80 percent of the residents hospitalized for coronavirus in the state were Black — vestiges of systemic racism in the democratic and health care systems.</p><p>Political power in the former Jim Crow South, where few Black Americans have been elected to statewide office, is inextricably linked to race. And Mr. Warnock’s place in the political universe is distinct from the election of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, or Northerners like former President Barack Obama, previously a senator from Illinois, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.</p><p>Together, Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff have the chance to expand Mr. Biden’s legislative agenda. But Mr. Warnock alone was seeking to overcome a barrier reinforced in the South over and over again, crystallized in a saying that become popular during the civil rights movement: “The South doesn’t care how close a Negro gets, just so he doesn’t get too high.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Black Democrats in Georgia said such history was not lost on them. Neither was how long it took the party to seriously pursue the possibility of success in Georgia.</p><p>“It took Democrats forever to invest in Georgia,” said Frazier Lively, a 71-year-old who lives in Macon and attended a recent rally. “Now you would hope what’s happening here is a message to what’s possible going forward.”</p></div></div><section id=\"reporter_update-f1efb5ed-f838-4411-a383-6724ed469ea1\" data-id=\"\"><div data-sourceid=\"\">\n      \n    <div id=\"62\"><div><p><img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/multimedia/author-danny-hakim/author-danny-hakim-thumbLarge.png\" alt=\"Danny Hakim headshot\"></p></div><p>With the races close, worth mentioning that if the result is within 0.5 percentage points, the losing candidate can seek a recount.

And now, with control of the Senate hinging on two runoff elections in Georgia, it is no surprise that mail-in ballots are getting attention again. Here is what we know about when they will be counted:</p><p><strong>Mail-in ballots could not be counted before the polls closed</strong>, even if they arrived before election day. But many ballots have already been processed, meaning envelope signatures and addresses have been verified, though the tallying of the votes themselves only began Tuesday night.</p><p>Of course, it is hard to say how long it will take for all of the mail-in ballots to be counted.</p><div><p>First, <strong>some mail-in ballots may not have been received yet</strong>. Although most Georgians had to get their ballots in by the time the polls closed at 7 p.m. Eastern, military and overseas voters have three additional days for their ballots to be received, as long as they mailed<em> </em>them by Tuesday.</p><p>Second, <strong>some counties will count their mail-in ballots faster than others.</strong></p><p>So when will all the mail-in ballots actually be counted?

Raphael Warnock — are doing better in some individual counties than benchmarks set in November.</p><p>In Fulton County, the most populous county in the state and a crucial Democratic area that includes Atlanta, Mr. Warnock appears to be winning a slightly higher percentage of the vote than President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. did when he beat President Trump. And in Macon County, also heavily Democratic, both Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff appear to have outperformed Mr. Biden.</p><div><p>Washington County, in eastern Georgia, appears to have voted for Mr. Ossoff after voting narrowly for his Republican opponent, Senator David Perdue, in November. (Mr. Warnock finished ahead of his Republican opponent, Senator Kelly Loeffler, in Washington County in November, but that race was so crowded with candidates that it’s hard to directly compare it to the runoff.)</p><p>Second, it was clear heading into Tuesday that Democrats had built up a strong advantage in early and mail-in voting, meaning Republicans needed excellent turnout on election day — and there are indications that they may not have gotten it.</p><p>In some rural, heavily Republican counties, it appears that turnout is less than 90 percent of what it was in November, whereas turnout in DeKalb County, Macon County and potentially other Democratic areas is expected to be more than 90 percent of what it was in November.</p><p>None of this is definitive. Only about half of the vote has been counted so far, and the second half could be more favorable to the Republicans. But as of halftime, they haven’t gotten a lot of good news.</p></div></div><section id=\"reporter_update-303884b6-06bd-4dbb-89eb-3b6a34a171df\" data-id=\"\"><div data-sourceid=\"\">\n      \n    <div id=\"46\"><div><p><img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/us/author-head-astead/author-head-astead-thumbLarge-v2.png\" alt=\"Astead Herndon headshot\"></p><div><p><h3 data-timestamp=\"2021-01-06T01:50:10.000Z\">2 hours ago</h3></p><h3>Astead Herndon<span> in Garden City, Ga.</span></h3></div></div><p>The Trump campaign spreading disinformation in a text to supporters: “Is it true that voting machines ‘stopped working’ earlier in Georgia today?

one level, how Republican voters have reacted to Mr. Trump’s quest to upend what he has falsely called a “rigged” election.</p><p>If Republican turnout is strong on Tuesday and lifts the party’s candidates to victory, it may be another sign of Mr. Trump’s ability to energize the G.O.P. base.</p><p>But if Republicans do not ultimately turn out in large numbers, the blame will fall at least partly on Mr. Trump for his efforts to raise doubts about the fairness of the state’s election process.</p><p>For Republicans in the state, the concern all along has been that Mr. Trump’s effort to undermine the election process will depress turnout, partly because he has stoked beliefs that the system itself cannot be trusted.</p><p>Charles S.

A small handful of precincts received court-ordered brief extensions because of problems earlier in the day.</p><p>We’re expecting votes to be counted <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/us/politics/when-will-we-know-georgia-runoff-results.html\" title=\"\">somewhat faster</a> than they were in November, because a new rule required Georgia election officials to begin processing early mail-in ballots at least a week before election day. This means that, while officials weren’t allowed to count anything before the polls closed, they should have already finished a great deal of the work of opening envelopes, verifying signatures and so forth.</p><div><p>Because of this, it is possible — but not guaranteed! — that we’ll know who won tonight.</p><p>That said, be very cautious about interpreting early results. Because votes cast before Tuesday are expected to be disproportionately Democratic and votes cast on election day are expected to be disproportionately Republican, a candidate who appears to be significantly behind at the beginning of the night could very well catch up by the end.</p><p>Keep in mind, too, that anyone who is in line by 7 p.m. has the right to vote, even it takes them several hours more to reach the ballot box.</p></div></div><div data-test-id=\"live-blog-post\" data-source-id=\"100000007535404\"><div><div><p><span><img

The problem was that there was nickels and dimes out there. The final thing, it went from, the president was up, I think, Thursday, by about 15,000 votes, and then by the following Monday, he was down by about 11,000 votes. So if you take all 5 million votes, we had 99-point-something of the votes in. So it depends on the margin and the number of ballots out there. We won’t know — we won’t have a better handle on that until after 1 o’clock tomorrow, probably. So we took off this morning pretty well. We had a little bit of those problems in Columbia County, which we’ve gone over. But now we’ve got to come in for the landing, which is closing the polling locations properly, making sure they get the memory cards out, and invariably Fulton and DeKalb has like one or two memory cards get left behind in a polling location. But for the most part, we’ve seen a pretty smooth election, and I think that’s a testament to these thousands of very hard-working elections officials and poll workers that have done yeoman’s work under high intensity. And we told them in January, this is before Covid even, we brought in outside consultants to tell them, you’re going to be under a microscope, you’re going to be under pressure. And little did they know when we were warning about this in January of 2020 that this was going to be culminating in literally the eyes of the world on us, because there’s no other thing happening in politics except here and then in Washington, D.C., tomorrow.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/05/us/politics/05georgia-elections-blog-sterling/05georgia-elections-blog-sterling-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg\" alt=\"Video player loading\"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span>Gabriel Sterling, a Georgia election official, said shortly before the polls were to close that there would most likely not be a final count of the votes until Wednesday afternoon.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Michael M.

Raphael Warnock into the lead over Senator Kelly Loeffler and putting Jon Ossoff a fraction of a percentage point behind David Perdue.Mr. Warnock is now ahead by about 35,000 votes, or over three-quarters of a percentage point, while Mr. Ossoff trails by several hundred votes. He is likely to move ahead of Mr. Perdue as more ballots are counted.The latest batch — around 150,000 votes — was a majority of the roughly 171,000 early votes that Georgia election officials had said remained to be counted in DeKalb County. (There was, briefly, some confusion when a county official told CNN that the number was 117,000; a top state election official, Gabriel Sterling, subsequently confirmed that the county official had accidentally transposed the 1 and the 7.)Mr. Sterling said DeKalb County still had about 12,000 election day votes left to count as well.Statewide, about 95 percent of all votes have been counted, and most of the remaining 5 percent are in Democratic areas like DeKalb and Fulton Counties, making both Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff favorites to win their races.On the question of when the count will be complete, Mr. Sterling said that lunchtime on Wednesday was “a rational estimate given the situation we’ve seen right now,” and praised the election officials working late into the night amid the vitriol and false charges of voter fraud advanced by President Trump and his supporters.“These thousands of election workers have been working diligently for a free and fair election for the people of Georgia,” Mr. Sterling said.\n      \n    13 minutes agoJennifer Medina Georgia election officials have suggested we may not know final numbers until midday tomorrow, right around the time when Congress is scheduled to certify the presidential election.

Biden Jr.’s top advisers appeared to have seen enough — if not to outright call the race in one Democrat’s favor, then at least to denounce his Republican opponent.In a pointed tweet, Ron Klain, the incoming White House chief of staff, suggested that Senator Kelly Loeffler had hurt her chances in the race against the Rev. Raphael Warnock by aligning herself with President Trump’s efforts to overturn the presidential election. Ms. Loeffler said on Monday that she planned to vote against the Electoral College certification process, joining a chorus of Republican senators in voting to overturn electors for Mr. Biden.“Spitballing here, but it may be that telling voters that you intend to ignore their verdict and overturn their votes from the November election was NOT a great closing argument for @KLoeffler,” Mr. Klain wrote shortly before 11 p.m.Spitballing here, but it may be that telling voters that you intend to ignore their verdict and overturn their votes from the November election was NOT a great closing argument for @KLoeffler— Ronald Klain (@RonaldKlain) January 6, 2021\nThe New York Times’s needle is showing that Mr. Warnock is “very likely” to defeat Ms. Loeffler.Should Mr. Warnock and Jon Ossoff, the other Democrat running, both win their races, Democrats would take control of the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as the chamber’s tiebreaking vote.\n      \n    18 minutes agoTrip Gabriel Though Ossoff trails Perdue by about 10,000 votes, the couple of counties with outstanding votes, DeKalb and Cobb, are Dem strongholds.

Those will skew heavily to the Democrats.  Credit...Audra Melton for The New York TimesA surge in turnout from Georgia’s Black voters has powered the fortunes of the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, putting the Democrats within reach of flipping two Senate seats and winning control of the chamber.Predominantly Black counties across rural Georgia have had turnout for Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff that nearly matched the Nov. 3 general election and margins that exceeded what President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. received when he defeated President Trump in the state.In Calhoun County, which is 61 percent Black and where most ballots had been counted late Tuesday, Mr. Warnock was ahead by 19 percentage points out of 2,031 votes cast and Mr. Ossoff had an edge of 18 points, compared with Mr. Biden’s 15 percent margin out of 2,198 votes in November.In Clay, Macon, Randolph and Washington Counties, all small, rural, predominantly Black counties, Mr. Ossoff and Mr. Warnock won larger margins than Mr. Biden did with turnout that nearly reached the November figures — an extraordinary feat given the nature of the runoffs.Some of Georgia’s largest counties in metropolitan Atlanta, which is home to the state’s largest concentration of Black voters, have yet to report a majority of their votes, though they are expected to soon.Data from TargetSmart, a Democratic political data firm, found that nearly 50,000 Black Georgians had cast early ballots in the Senate runoffs after not voting in the Nov. 3 general election.Scores of grass-roots organizations worked to turn out Black voters in the lead-up to the runoffs, and on a campaign swing last weekend, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris targeted Black neighborhoods where early-voting turnout had been soft. “The Black vote delivered the U.S. Senate for Democrats,” said Tom Bonier, the chief executive of TargetSmart.\n      \n    54 minutes agoJennifer Medina Trump tweeted a false suggestion that Democrats were “waiting to see how many votes they need.” His claim was particularly baffling since he pressed Georgia officials for just enough votes to overturn his loss.  \n      \n    The G.O.P. lead has grown, but it’s made no dent in our estimate. In fact, Democratic chances have inched upward as the Republicans’ chances to beat our expectations dwindle.

Jan. 5, 2021, 10:36 p.m. ET1 hour ago1 hour agoBy Nate CohnCredit...Ben Gray/Associated PressThe Democrats now appear favored to prevail in both of their Senate races in Georgia, and therefore are the favorites to take control of the U.S. Senate. The two Republican candidates hold small leads in the vote count, and still have a chance to hold onto those advantages, but most of the remaining vote is in Democratic-leaning areas.The largest block of remaining ballots is the in-person vote in DeKalb County, a heavily Democratic area that includes part of Atlanta. Over all, the two Democratic candidates are favored to win the remaining vote by around nine percentage points, according to Upshot estimates.Democrats benefited from strong turnout among Black voters, who are on track to represent a much larger share of the electorate than they did in the general election, based on the turnout by precinct and early voting data.With 5 percent of the vote left to count, the Rev. Raphael Warnock’s projected lead over Senator Kelly Loeffler is larger than Jon Ossoff’s projected lead over David Perdue. It’s hard to say when either race will be called. The Ossoff-Perdue call might have to wait until late absentee and provisional ballots are counted.Jan. 5, 2021, 10:35 p.m. ET1 hour ago1 hour agoBy The New York Times\n      \n    AtlantaLynsey Weatherspoon for The New York TimesAtlantaBen Gray/Associated PressAtlantaAlex Wong/Getty ImagesMariettaNicole Craine for The New York TimesAtlantaErik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstockslide 1slide 2slide 3slide 4slide 5After a relatively smooth day at the polls, Georgia began the long process of counting votes and awaiting results.\n      \n    If the Dems exceed Biden’s margins in blue counties, that seems to support Stacey Abrams’s argument that the key is not persuading swing voters, it’s getting left-leaning voters to the polls.  \n      \n    Republicans pleaded with Trump to care about this race. And as the runoff approached, they worried he had become more disengaged because he didn’t want to help in a state he’d lost.  Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times[Read more on the history Raphael Warnock is chasing.]Democrats were growing increasingly optimistic on Tuesday night that their candidates could prevail in Georgia’s Senate races — particularly the Rev. Raphael Warnock, who appeared to be performing slightly more strongly than Jon Ossoff, the party’s other contender.If Mr. Warnock were to succeed, it would be a fitting culmination to an election cycle in which, hours after Joseph R. Biden Jr. was declared the president-elect, he told Black voters in his victory speech, “You’ve always had my back, and I’ll have yours.”It would also be a generational breakthrough for Southern Black Democrats.Mr. Warnock, 51, the pastor who took the pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, has spoken on the campaign trail about his life experiences as a Black man born and raised in the South. He is running for office in a state where people in predominantly Black neighborhoods waited in disproportionately long lines to vote last year, and where one study found that more than 80 percent of the residents hospitalized for coronavirus in the state were Black — vestiges of systemic racism in the democratic and health care systems.Political power in the former Jim Crow South, where few Black Americans have been elected to statewide office, is inextricably linked to race. And Mr. Warnock’s place in the political universe is distinct from the election of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, or Northerners like former President Barack Obama, previously a senator from Illinois, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.Together, Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff have the chance to expand Mr. Biden’s legislative agenda. But Mr. Warnock alone was seeking to overcome a barrier reinforced in the South over and over again, crystallized in a saying that become popular during the civil rights movement: “The South doesn’t care how close a Negro gets, just so he doesn’t get too high.”On Tuesday, Black Democrats in Georgia said such history was not lost on them. Neither was how long it took the party to seriously pursue the possibility of success in Georgia.“It took Democrats forever to invest in Georgia,” said Frazier Lively, a 71-year-old who lives in Macon and attended a recent rally. “Now you would hope what’s happening here is a message to what’s possible going forward.”\n      \n    With the races close, worth mentioning that if the result is within 0.5 percentage points, the losing candidate can seek a recount. Ballots would be run through the scanners again.  \n      \n    Chatham County, which includes Warnock’s hometown, Savannah, and Cobb County, an increasingly diverse Atlanta suburb, still have large chunks of uncounted votes.  \n      \n    DeKalb County, which has lagged other Atlanta-area counties in its reporting tonight, is the state’s fourth most populous county and tilts overwhelmingly Democratic.  \n      \n    Both Democrats remain heavily favored, despite their deficit in the tabulated vote. They’re favored to win the vote left to be counted by 9 to 10 points. See the forecast \n      \n    1 hour agoMatt Flegenheimer A lesson many Dems learned the hard way in the Obama years: Not so easy getting a president’s voters to show up when he’s not on the ballot. G.O.P. saw this in ’18 and is anxious about the same tonight.  \n      \n    Question hanging over the night: If Perdue and Loeffler lose, how much sway will Trump hold with congressional Republicans tomorrow as he pushes them to object to certification of his loss?  \n      \n    In Richmond County (Augusta) in November, the Democrats led by 36 percentage points. With almost all the votes counted, Warnock is leading by 43 points. Ossoff’s lead is similar.  \n      \n    In counties where most votes are counted and Warnock is leading, he’s exceeding the Dems’ margin in November by several points. In red counties Loeffler has about the same margin as the Republicans in November.  Jan. 5, 2021, 9:34 p.m. ET2 hours ago2 hours agoBy Maggie AstorCredit...Erik S Lesser/EPA, via ShutterstockGabriel Sterling, a Republican election official in Georgia who has forcefully condemned President Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the presidential election there, said Tuesday evening that if Republicans lost the two Senate runoffs — a real possibility based on early results — it would be Mr. Trump’s fault.The blame would “fall squarely on the shoulders of President Trump and his actions since Nov. 3,” Mr. Sterling said on CNN.Asked what he would tell Mr. Trump if he were watching the interview, Mr. Sterling said: “Mr. President, you’ve already lost the state of Georgia. The thing now is, no matter what you say, you can’t undermine the people of Georgia’s integrity to know their voting system works and their vote is going to count.”Just a day earlier, on Monday, Mr. Sterling had made an emotional plea to Georgians not to let the president’s false claims of election fraud deter them from participating in the runoff elections, which will determine which party controls the Senate and how much President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is able to accomplish. And he was far from the only Republican official with that concern.In a news conference after his CNN appearance, Mr. Sterling said that 64 of Georgia’s 159 counties had fully reported their results, with the largest number of uncounted votes remaining in DeKalb County, a Democratic stronghold.\n      \n    More votes from Republican strongholds have come in, pushing the G.O.P. hopefuls into small leads for the moment. But a lot of Democrat-leaning ballots remain around Atlanta.  \n      \n    The race now leans toward the Democrats. There’s a long way to go and it’s close, but they have done better than they need across all vote methods and in all regions. See the forecast Jan. 5, 2021, 9:11 p.m. ET3 hours ago3 hours agoBy Sydney EmberCredit...Lynsey Weatherspoon for The New York TimesAll eyes were on mail-in ballots when general election results were tallied in November. And now, with control of the Senate hinging on two runoff elections in Georgia, it is no surprise that mail-in ballots are getting attention again. Here is what we know about when they will be counted:Mail-in ballots could not be counted before the polls closed, even if they arrived before election day. But many ballots have already been processed, meaning envelope signatures and addresses have been verified, though the tallying of the votes themselves only began Tuesday night.Of course, it is hard to say how long it will take for all of the mail-in ballots to be counted.First, some mail-in ballots may not have been received yet. Although most Georgians had to get their ballots in by the time the polls closed at 7 p.m. Eastern, military and overseas voters have three additional days for their ballots to be received, as long as they mailed them by Tuesday.Second, some counties will count their mail-in ballots faster than others.So when will all the mail-in ballots actually be counted? Only time will tell.\n      \n    Rockdale County is the largest thus far to report it has completed vote counting. The results there: Democrats are outperforming their November numbers by about 4 percentage points.  \n      \n    The northern Atlanta suburbs of the 6th Congressional District are a bellwether: home to Newt Gingrich, won by Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. Watch northern Fulton and DeKalb Counties and eastern Cobb County.  Jan. 5, 2021, 8:55 p.m. ET3 hours ago3 hours agoBy Maggie AstorCredit...Audra Melton for The New York TimesWhile both Georgia Senate races are still much too close to call, there is some positive news for Democrats in the early returns.First, it appears that the Democratic candidates — Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock — are doing better in some individual counties than benchmarks set in November.In Fulton County, the most populous county in the state and a crucial Democratic area that includes Atlanta, Mr. Warnock appears to be winning a slightly higher percentage of the vote than President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. did when he beat President Trump. And in Macon County, also heavily Democratic, both Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff appear to have outperformed Mr. Biden.Washington County, in eastern Georgia, appears to have voted for Mr. Ossoff after voting narrowly for his Republican opponent, Senator David Perdue, in November. (Mr. Warnock finished ahead of his Republican opponent, Senator Kelly Loeffler, in Washington County in November, but that race was so crowded with candidates that it’s hard to directly compare it to the runoff.)Second, it was clear heading into Tuesday that Democrats had built up a strong advantage in early and mail-in voting, meaning Republicans needed excellent turnout on election day — and there are indications that they may not have gotten it.In some rural, heavily Republican counties, it appears that turnout is less than 90 percent of what it was in November, whereas turnout in DeKalb County, Macon County and potentially other Democratic areas is expected to be more than 90 percent of what it was in November.None of this is definitive. Only about half of the vote has been counted so far, and the second half could be more favorable to the Republicans. But as of halftime, they haven’t gotten a lot of good news.\n      \n    2 hours agoAstead Herndon in Garden City, Ga.The Trump campaign spreading disinformation in a text to supporters: “Is it true that voting machines ‘stopped working’ earlier in Georgia today?

Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesThe elections on Tuesday in Georgia are set to reveal the extent to which President Trump has disrupted and damaged his own party.For the last several weeks, Mr. Trump has instigated and intensified a battle royal within the Georgia Republican universe as he has sought to overturn his loss there and pin blame on the state’s G.O.P. leaders for not helping him.In response, the state’s Republicans have turned on one another, taking sides for or against Mr. Trump as he continues in his obstinate — some say unlawful — effort to overturn the election results in Georgia, where he lost by nearly 12,000 votes.The outcome of these Senate elections will show, on one level, how Republican voters have reacted to Mr. Trump’s quest to upend what he has falsely called a “rigged” election.If Republican turnout is strong on Tuesday and lifts the party’s candidates to victory, it may be another sign of Mr. Trump’s ability to energize the G.O.P. base.But if Republicans do not ultimately turn out in large numbers, the blame will fall at least partly on Mr. Trump for his efforts to raise doubts about the fairness of the state’s election process.For Republicans in the state, the concern all along has been that Mr. Trump’s effort to undermine the election process will depress turnout, partly because he has stoked beliefs that the system itself cannot be trusted.Charles S. Bullock III, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, said Mr. Trump’s phone call Saturday pressuring Georgia’s secretary of state to overturn the presidential election results there could also turn some of the president’s former supporters against the Republican candidates.“They may say, ‘This has gone too far. I can’t vote against Trump, but I can vote against his surrogates,’” Mr. Bullock said in an interview on Monday.Jan. 5, 2021, 7:01 p.m. ET5 hours ago5 hours agoBy Maggie Astor\n      \n    MariettaChang W.

A small handful of precincts received court-ordered brief extensions because of problems earlier in the day.We’re expecting votes to be counted somewhat faster than they were in November, because a new rule required Georgia election officials to begin processing early mail-in ballots at least a week before election day. This means that, while officials weren’t allowed to count anything before the polls closed, they should have already finished a great deal of the work of opening envelopes, verifying signatures and so forth.Because of this, it is possible — but not guaranteed! — that we’ll know who won tonight.That said, be very cautious about interpreting early results. Because votes cast before Tuesday are expected to be disproportionately Democratic and votes cast on election day are expected to be disproportionately Republican, a candidate who appears to be significantly behind at the beginning of the night could very well catch up by the end.Keep in mind, too, that anyone who is in line by 7 p.m. has the right to vote, even it takes them several hours more to reach the ballot box.Jan. 5, 2021, 7:00 p.m. ET5 hours ago5 hours agoBy Jenny Catherall and Arthur Thompson\n      \n    Kristi Royston, elections supervisorBy Jenny Catherall and Arthur ThompsonEric Johnston, voterBy Jenny Catherall and Arthur ThompsonKent Walker, voterBy Jenny Catherall and Arthur ThompsonKristi Royston, elections supervisorBy Jenny Catherall and Arthur Phillipsslide 1slide 2slide 3slide 4In an extremely tight race with national implications, all eyes turned to the ballot counting process in Georgia, where state officials told us they’re determined to get it right.

The problem was that there was nickels and dimes out there. The final thing, it went from, the president was up, I think, Thursday, by about 15,000 votes, and then by the following Monday, he was down by about 11,000 votes. So if you take all 5 million votes, we had 99-point-something of the votes in. So it depends on the margin and the number of ballots out there. We won’t know — we won’t have a better handle on that until after 1 o’clock tomorrow, probably. So we took off this morning pretty well. We had a little bit of those problems in Columbia County, which we’ve gone over. But now we’ve got to come in for the landing, which is closing the polling locations properly, making sure they get the memory cards out, and invariably Fulton and DeKalb has like one or two memory cards get left behind in a polling location. But for the most part, we’ve seen a pretty smooth election, and I think that’s a testament to these thousands of very hard-working elections officials and poll workers that have done yeoman’s work under high intensity. And we told them in January, this is before Covid even, we brought in outside consultants to tell them, you’re going to be under a microscope, you’re going to be under pressure. And little did they know when we were warning about this in January of 2020 that this was going to be culminating in literally the eyes of the world on us, because there’s no other thing happening in politics except here and then in Washington, D.C., tomorrow.”Gabriel Sterling, a Georgia election official, said shortly before the polls were to close that there would most likely not be a final count of the votes until Wednesday afternoon.CreditCredit...Michael M. Santiago/Getty ImagesGabriel Sterling, a top Georgia election official, told reporters shortly before the polls were scheduled to close that the day had gone mostly smoothly, but that a handful of precincts would stay open past 7 p.m. because of problems earlier in the day.As of when Mr. Sterling appeared around 6:15 p.m. Eastern, courts had ordered extended hours at six polling locations and were considering requests for extensions at four other locations. These sorts of orders are not unusual, and most of the extensions are very short: In Columbia County, for instance, Precinct 65 will be open until 7:01 p.m. instead of 7, and Precinct 34 will be open until 7:04.A few of the extensions are longer, though. The Old Chatham County Courthouse in Savannah will be open until 7:33, Beach High School in Savannah will be open until 7:35, and the Eldorado precinct in Tift County will be open until 7:40.Ware County could also request an extension because of an accident that shut down the main road to one polling place.Mr. Sterling added that Georgia’s voter information website, where people can do things like look up their polling place or check on the status of their absentee ballot, had been slowed earlier in the day when a single IP address began sending several requests per second. He said officials had responded by blocking the IP address, which was domestic.Credit...Virginie Kippelen/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe winners of Georgia’s dual Senate runoff elections may not be known for days, but the battle is already one for the record books — with the November election and the January runoffs combining to occupy the top two slots on the list of most expensive legislative races in history.All told, donors big and small have shelled out about $830 million to independent expenditure groups, party committees and the candidates themselves, according to an analysis of federal elections data and a summary compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.Much of that cash, more than $490 million in the last two months of the runoffs, has been spent on television, digital and radio advertising, according to data from AdImpact, a media-tracking firm.The race between David Perdue, a Republican whose Senate term ended over the weekend, and his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, is the most expensive ever, drawing about $470 million when the general election and the runoff are combined.The battle between Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican, and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, is a close second-place finisher, with a $362 million price tag as of mid-December, when the most recent Federal Election Commission filings were made. These numbers could rise steeply when final tallies are released after the election.A staggering 215 outside groups contributed to the Perdue-Ossoff race, contributing $271 million in all, with Mr. Ossoff out-raising Mr. Perdue by about $50 million. More than a hundred groups have shelled out a combined $171 million in the Loeffler-Warnock race, with Mr. Warnock enjoying a $28 million edge in fund-raising, according to the Center for Responsive Politics analysis.The blowout numbers do not merely reflect the stakes of the Georgia race, or the expensive ad rates in the Atlanta media market: They also reflect a financial arms race focused on the Senate in which records were shattered in many states.In fact, nine of the 10 most expensive Senate campaigns in the country’s history took place in 2020, the center found.","article_len":31850,"domain":"https://www.nytimes.com/","updated":false,"found_urls":[{"title":"Skip to
