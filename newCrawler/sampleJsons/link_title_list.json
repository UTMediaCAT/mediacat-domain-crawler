morning on January 3, 2020, when news arrived that an American drone had targeted a convoy of vehicles in Iraq’s capital, in which a top Iranian general was believed to have been killed.</p>\n<p>Before the hour was up, Iraqi state television corroborated what many had suspected: Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani was among the 10 victims in the deadly strike, which the United States later said was part of a wider strategy to deter enemies.</p>\n<p>By the time Iraqis woke that morning, the news had sent shockwaves across the globe, with some Iraqis comparing their disbelief to what they felt when Saddam Hussein was toppled.</p>\n<p>“It was something you could not believe – Soleimani was thought to be invincible but he died,” said a man from Baghdad, who did not
